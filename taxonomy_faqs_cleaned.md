## Climate Delegated Act

### Will the technical screening criteria set out in the Climate Delegated Act be made stricter and updated over time?

Article 19(5) of the Taxonomy Regulation requires the Commission to regularly review the TSC defining substantial contribution to environmental objectives and DNSH to those objectives. In case of activities identified as transitional in the Climate Delegated Act, the review would be conducted at least every three years to ensure the criteria remain on a credible transition pathway consistent with a climate-neutral economy. No minimum period is specified for the other activities. The TSC will be updated over time to keep them aligned with overall policy objectives, technological developments and the availability of scientifically robust evidence justifying the introduction of new or updated criteria.

In accordance with Article 20(2) of the Taxonomy Regulation, the Platform on Sustainable Finance shall advise the Commission on the development of additional TSC, including for additional activities, and updating of existing TSC.

Based on this advice, the EU’s trajectory relative to its sustainability targets as well as on other feedback, the Commission may review the TSC and, where appropriate, amend the delegated acts establishing these criteria. As a result, the TSC could become stricter over time.

### How will the Taxonomy be further developed – will there be more activities contributing to climate change mitigation (CCM) included in the Climate Delegated Act?

Yes, the Taxonomy will continue to be developed over time. As far as climate change mitigation (CCM) is concerned, the Climate Delegated Act prioritised economic sectors and activities with the highest potential to make a substantial contribution to GHG emission reduction based on their share of overall emissions and their potential to reduce emissions. The scope defined for CCM has been replicated for climate change adaptation(48)See Annex 6 of the impact assessment accompanying the first Climate Delegated Act for details available at: https://ec.europa.eu/finance/docs/level-2-measures/taxonomy-regulation-delegated-act-2021-2800-impact-assessment_en.pdf. 

However, not all activities potentially contributing substantially to climate objectives were included in the first Climate Delegated Act. A Complementary Climate Delegated Act amending the Climate Delegated Act was adopted to cover as transitional activities certain economic activities involving specific gas and nuclear-related technologies that were not part of the Climate Delegated Act.

In addition, further activities contributing to the climate objectives may be included in the Climate Delegated Act at the time of its future review or of the adoption of any future delegated acts containing activities contributing to the other four non-climate environmental objectives. 

### What does checking the compliance with the TSC on the substantial contribution and the DNSH mean in practice?

The checking of compliance with the TSC requires the collection and assessment of relevant information in order to determine if the economic activity fulfils the conditions set out in the TSC. All criteria related to substantial contribution and DNSH, as well as the minimum social safeguards referred to in Article 18 of the Taxonomy Regulation have to be met for an activity to be considered Taxonomy-aligned. For further guidance, users may consult the Taxonomy user guide on the Commission’s website(49)[add link when available]. 

### How should verification requirements in the technical screening criteria be understood? What documentary evidence could support the demonstration and verification of compliance with those criteria?

The Climate Delegated Act contains specific verification requirements for certain activities, in line with point (k) of Article 19(1) of the Taxonomy Regulation, which requires that the TSC are easy to use and be set in a manner that facilitates the verification of their compliance. This is the case where the criteria rely on elements that require specialist knowledge. The accuracy of such information would be difficult to check for investors. Therefore, the TSC for specific activities include external verification requirements for activities where such concerns are present. Where the Climate Delegated Act requires verification for certain activities, the report by the external verifier would constitute the evidence of compliance with those criteria. External verifiers can be either the relevant national competent authorities or an independent third-party verifier having no conflict of interest with the operator of the activity nor be involved in the development or operation of the activity.

For example, the forest management plans in Sections 1.1.-1.4. on the forestry activities are highly context specific, and therefore external verification of these plans and their implementation is necessary to give sufficient certainty to investors. For several energy and some manufacturing activities, such as ‘Manufacture of other low carbon technologies’ in Sections 3.6., ‘Manufacture of plastics in primary form’ in Section 3.17., ‘Electricity generation from geothermal energy’ in Section 4.6., specific thresholds for GHG emissions are central to the TSC, and their external verification can serve to inform investors of compliance with TSC. 

Where required, details of the verification of the criteria should form part of the disclosure of Taxonomy-alignment. Taxonomy-verification requirements are set to evolve together with other sustainability-reporting under the CSRD, once it enters into application. 

### Can technical consultancy services be counted as Taxonomy-eligible, and potentially Taxonomy-aligned, if they are related to an activity defined in the Taxonomy Delegated Acts?

Only activities that are themselves set out in the Climate Delegated Act can be Taxonomy-eligible. 

Thus, only the consultancy services that are explicitly covered by the Taxonomy, in particular with regard to climate change mitigation, in _‘Professional services related to energy performance of buildings’_ in Section 9.3. and, with regard to climate change adaptation, in ‘ _Computer programming, consultancy and related activities’_ in Section 8.1. and ‘ _Engineering activities and related technical consultancy dedicated to adaptation to climate change’_ in Section 9.1. 

In order to determine whether an activity is Taxonomy-eligible, the description of the activity must be used. The references to NACE codes with which such an activity could be associated are used for orientation purposes. 

Consultancy services related to other Taxonomy-eligible activities listed in the Climate Delegated Act are not eligible.

### How should GHG emissions for technical screening criteria be calculated (scope, methodologies etc.)?

There is no universal calculation method for GHG emissions in the Climate Delegated Act. Specific calculation methods are set out in the TSC for specific activities, in line with the methodological approaches based on the requirements laid out in Article 19 of the Taxonomy Regulation. See also on this point responses to activity specific questions, such as for instance Question 52.

### How can an undertaking's activities that are carried out in jurisdictions outside the EU be assessed for compliance with the technical screening criteria by reference to local third-country requirements or guidelines? When criteria refer to EU/national legislation or standards, should the level of requirements be adapted for criteria to be achieved outside the EU?

As set out in the answer to question 18 of the first Commission Notice, disclosure obligations under Article 8 of the Taxonomy Regulation apply to entities subject to the scope of the NFRD and to all their activities regardless of their location. While several of the TSC set out objective thresholds and requirements which do not refer to any location-specific regulatory requirements, some TSC refer to jurisdiction-specific requirements laid out in EU legislation. In general, for assessing the Taxonomy-alignment of an economic activity conducted outside the EU, undertakings should ascertain whether it is performed in compliance with the requirement applicable in Union legislation or, where mentioned in the TSC, a relevant international standard or equivalent applicable national law in a third country (for instance, references to such standards in the generic DNSH criteria for biodiversity protection set out in [Appendix D](./assets/documents/None Appendix D.pdf) of Annex I).

### How to interpret the use of “and” and “or” in the description of economic activities (for instance in ‘Construction or operation of electricity generation facilities that produce electricity from hydropower’ in Section 4.5; or ‘Construction and operation of electricity generation installations that produce electricity exclusively from biomass, biogas or bioliquids’ in Section 4.8)?

The terms ‘and’ and ‘or’ are used interchangeably in the activity descriptions but not in the criteria where ‘and’ refers to a cumulative requirement. In general, an economic activity is Taxonomy-eligible if it constitutes any of the steps referenced in the description of the activity in bringing that activity to market (e.g. construction, operation, refurbishment, installation, maintenance etc.).

### How to deal with technical screening criteria that are not relevant to a specific activity mentioned in the description (e.g. a maintenance-only service with no construction-related waste)?

If the economic activity manifestly does not involve an element addressed by the TSC, an explanation of this fact can be provided in the disclosure of why the activity qualifies as Taxonomy-aligned without fulfillment of a specific criterion (e.g. the provision of a service included in the description which has no impact on other environmental objectives and thereby does not give rise to any potential issues with a DNSH-criterion). 

### In a number of cases of enabling activities, benchmarks compared to industry averages, peers or best available technologies are required. However, such information is not always available publicly. How should the requirement to provide these benchmarks be met?

The TSC are not always exhaustive in how activities can qualify but in specific cases leave scope for case-by-case assessments by economic operators. Where the information required to demonstrate compliance relative to a metric or industry best practice depends on multiple factors or cannot be expressed in a straightforward way, operators should provide appropriate explanations, including any relevant independent third-party opinions, in their disclosures of why the activity is considered to qualify as Taxonomy-aligned.

### How does the sustainable finance framework apply to access to private funding for the defence industry?

The Commission acknowledges the need to ensure access to finance and investment including from the private sector for all strategic sectors, in particular the defence industry which contributes to European citizens' security. 

In its communication of 15 February 2022 on European defence (COM(2022) 60) the Commission highlighted the need for initiatives on sustainable finance to remain consistent with the European Union efforts to facilitate the European defence industry’s sufficient access to finance and investment. The EU Sustainable Finance Framework focuses on ensuring transparency and does not impose any limitations to the financing any specific sector, including the defence sector.

Like in any sector, undertakings involved in defence-related activities can claim Taxonomy-alignment for eligible horizontal investments stipulated in the Climate Delegated Act. This includes, for example, investments in greening their buildings, or investment in clean transport in the form of CapEx and/or OpEx referred to in point (c) of Sections 1.1.2.2. and 1.1.3.2 of Annex I to Disclosures Delegated Act. They can also claim alignment for any other activities identified in the Climate Delegated Act (for example activities in the field of transport, data solutions, manufacturing etc.). 

EU rules on sustainability disclosures apply horizontally across all industries equally and they do not single out a particular sector. 

There is an explicit reference directly relevant for a limited part of the defence sector in one regulatory technical standard (RTS) under the Sustainable Finance Disclosures Regulation (SFDR), specifying further how financial market participants should disclose information about their principal adverse sustainability impacts (PAIs). This regulatory standard covers exposure to four categories of controversial weapons (anti-personnel mines, cluster munitions, chemical weapons, and biological weapons). For the remaining part of the RTS under the SFDR, the requirements (including on social aspects) are the same as for any other sector. 

Similarly, the rules on MiFID/IDD sustainability preferences for retail investors apply horizontally across all industries equally and do not single out any specific sector. Therefore, they do not prevent investments in any specific sector. The principal adverse impacts taken into consideration in the financial product only concern the controversial weapons as referred to above. 

As part of a broader work following up on the European Council conclusions of March 2022 to promote and facilitate access to private funding for the defence industry, the European Defence Agency launched in May 2022 a study to provide an overview of ESG frameworks applied on financial markets and how they regard defence industry or defence industry related activities. The aim is to measure and benchmark the European defence industry’s activities in relation to environmental, social and governance (ESG) criteria, and provide an analysis of the sector’s contribution to the objectives set out by ESG-related frameworks. 

### How about companies without any Taxonomy-aligned activities? Will they lose access to finance?

No. The mere fact that a company does not have Taxonomy-aligned activities does not mean that conclusions can be drawn regarding the company’s environmental performance or its ability to access finance. 

There is also no obligation on companies to have activities aligned with the EU Taxonomy and there is no obligation on investors to invest in Taxonomy-aligned activities. 

Overall, there is likely to be a higher interest in Taxonomy-aligned activities from investors who are seeking sustainable investments. 

There are several reasons why a company might not have economic activities that are eligible or aligned with the criteria of the EU Taxonomy: its economic activities might simply not be covered by the EU Taxonomy, or it may be covered but not make a substantial contribution to an environmental objective; or it might make a substantial contribution but not meet the do no significant harm criteria or the minimum social safeguards. Therefore, without knowing the exact reasons why a company has no Taxonomy-aligned activities, market participants cannot make investment decisions purely on the basis of Taxonomy-related disclosures of companies, because not having Taxonomy-aligned activities does not, in itself, reveal the company’s exact environmental performance. Instead, other disclosures, such as the company’s disclosures under the CSRD will help inform markets about the company’s environmental performance and the company’s direction of travel on environmental matters.

Just as companies need to manage their portfolio of activities and should aim to gradually increase the share of green activities, similarly it can be expected that most investors will aim to gradually increase the share of sustainable investments in their portfolios. It is also important to keep in mind that financial market participants who are making decisions about allocating capital will take into account more elements than just the Taxonomy alignment. For all companies within the scope of the CSRD, even for companies not undertaking economic activities that are Taxonomy-aligned, investors will have at their disposal both (i) Taxonomy disclosures, and (ii) the information reported according to the CSRD. Aside from legally binding disclosures, companies can also make voluntary disclosures. Investors may use all of these disclosures when making investment decisions and financial products. Investors are free to design their investments as they wish and will continue to make investment decisions taking into account a large number of factors. 

### The DNSH criteria for pollution prevention and control of the activity “Afforestation” in Section 1.1. specify that the activity should minimise the use of fertilisers and not use manure. Should the use of natural fertilisers also be minimised?

The DNSH criterion requires the minimisation of fertilisers by favouring the use of alternative approaches or techniques including non-chemical or natural fertilisers. In cases where non-chemical or natural fertilisers are used, their overall consumption should be kept at a minimum and take account of broader ecosystem impacts.

### How is the term “degradation of land with high carbon stocks” in the activity “Afforestation” in Section 1.1. defined?

The Climate Delegated Act defines land with high-carbon stock by referring to Article 29(4), points (a), (b) and (c) of RED II, which provides:

 _“[…] land with high-carbon stock, namely land that had one of the following statuses in January 2008 and no longer has that status:_

 _(a) wetlands, namely land that is covered with or saturated by water permanently or for a significant part of the year;_

 _(b) continuously forested areas, namely land spanning more than one hectare with trees higher than five metres and a canopy cover of more than 30 %, or trees able to reach those thresholds in situ;_

 _(c) land spanning more than one hectare with trees higher than five metres and a canopy cover of between 10 % and 30 %, or trees able to reach those thresholds in situ, unless evidence is provided that the carbon stock of the area before and after conversion is such that, when the methodology laid down in Part C of Annex V is applied, the conditions laid down in paragraph 10 of this Article would be fulfilled.”_

The Climate Delegated Act does not provide a definition of degradation. However, the overall purpose of the criterion is to maintain the high carbon stock and avoid GHG emissions from that stock. 

### What does “in accordance with the terms and conditions laid down in national law” mean in the context of the activity “Rehabilitation and restoration of forests” in Section 1.2.? What if national law does not require such consideration?

In the context of point 1.2. (g) of the substantial contribution criteria to climate change mitigation of the activity _“Rehabilitation and restoration of forests_ ” in Section 1.2, the reference to a consultation of stakeholders in accordance with the terms and conditions set out in national law regarding consideration of societal issues, is not further defined in the Climate Delegated Act. If there is no specific national law, that should be stated in the information provided under point 1.2. 

### Where is the boundary between the activity “Rehabilitation and restoration of forests” in Section 1.2 and the activity “Forest management” in Section 1.3 in the case when forest management includes reforestation after a clear cut or a natural disturbance? Specifically, under which section does the reforestation after an outbreak of pests fall?

The reforestation after an outbreak of pests would be covered under the activity “Rehabilitation and restoration of forests” in Section 1.2 as the title of the activity states _"including after an extreme event"._

###  What is the meaning of a “continuously updated” forest management plan? Does this mean renewed after the end of its validity, in the occurrence of significant events, or yearly? Or is it about having evidence of the work done in the forest?

The frequency of updates of forest management plans is not defined in the TSC, allowing for a scope for reflecting national requirements. As mentioned in the FAO Sustainable Forest Management Toolbox(50)See: www.fao.org/sustainable-forest-management/toolbox/modules/forest-management-planning/in-more-depth/en/, continuous improvement through accumulating learning is an integral part of sustainable forest management, and forest management plans need to be reviewed regularly and revised accordingly as conditions change. The continuity aspect also includes the need to ensure that there is no break in time between different forest management plan updates. In the case of a 10-year-long forest management plan, the frequency should be at least 10 years. 

### Are the criteria of points 2.1 (a) and (b) of the substantial contribution criteria of the activity “Forest management” in Section 1.3 fulfilled if management systems are in place at forest sourcing level to ensure carbon stock and sink levels are maintained or strengthened?

No, only point 2.1 (b) is fulfilled in this case. It is still necessary to carry out a climate benefit analysis over a period of 30 years in accordance with point 2.1. (a), possibly using the management system in place at forest sourcing level as the baseline. 

### What does the criterion in point 2.3 (c) of the substantial contribution criteria of the activity “Forest management” in Section 1.3 mean in practice?

The criterion in point 2.3. (c) provides that _"the resolution of the analysis is proportionate to the size of the area concerned and values specific to the area concerned are used"_.

The criterion underlines that the climate benefit analysis needs to be tailored to the size of the area and the specific context, for example by using the growth assumptions associated with the specific soil and climatic conditions. 

### Criterion in point 2.4 of the substantial contribution criteria of the activity “Forest management” in Section 1.3. provide that forest holdings under 13ha are not required to perform a climate benefit analysis. What are the requirements for an owner of a 14 hectare forest holding?

The provisions in point 2.4 of Section 1.3 ”Forest management” exempt forest holdings under 13ha, which corresponds to the average size of a forest holding in Europe, from the requirement to perform a climate benefit analysis. The owner of a 14 hectare forest holding needs therefore to carry out such an analysis to comply with forest management criteria, unless he can demonstrate compliance with this requirement at forest sourcing area level, as specified in point 2.1.

### How will the compliance of the activity with the criteria set out in point 2.3 (a) of the activity “Forest management” in Section 1.3. be evaluated, especially the analysis considering a risk of leakage?

The criteria regarding audit referred to in point 4 of the TSC provide an additional level of assurance for the reported data. Reference is also made to the reply to Question 4 in Section I of this Notice. 

### What does “in accordance with national law” referred to in point 3.1. mean in the context of the guarantee of permanence? What if national law does not require such consideration?

This reference means that the different measures that can be used to provide a guarantee of permanence for the forest status should, where applicable, comply with national law (such as for options in points (b) or (c) of point 3.1., where the area is classified as a protected area or the area is subject to a legal or contractual agreement). 

Where national law does not require such considerations, reference is made to the reply to question 15 of this Notice.

### Is the criterion set out in point 3.1. of the substantial contribution criteria of the activity “Forest management” in Section 1.3. to be understood that there must be a contractual agreement that the forest area in question cannot be changed to other land use?

No, that is not an exclusive requirement. The criterion includes a contractual agreement as one possible way to fulfil the requirement laid out in point 3.1. of Section 1.3.

### What does “beyond the activity that is financed” mean in the context of the guarantee of permanence referred to in point 3.2. in Section 1.3.?

 _"The activity that is financed"_ refers to the activity that is currently carried out and aims to qualify for Taxonomy-alignment. The terms “ _beyond the activity that is financed”_ imply that the activity would seek climate benefits also beyond the scope of the activity. 

### Is a forest certification audit enough to verify compliance with the technical screening criteria?

Forest certification may be used to demonstrate compliance with the TSC. However, a forest certification does not, in itself, demonstrate compliance with the TSC. 

Any audit, including through a forest certification process, that addresses all applicable aspects of the criteria is suitable. Reference is also made to the reply to question 4 in Section I of this Notice. 

### How can it be known in advance that “the group of those holdings remains the same for all subsequent audits” as referred to in point 5(b) in Section 1.3.? Why does it matter if the group changes between audits?

This condition aims to ensure the comparability of the information and requires a durable relationship if it is chosen to check compliance at the level of a group of holdings. The Delegated Act does not further prescribe how participants in such a group organise their cooperation. 

### What happens when the DNSH criteria are assessed at the level of the “group of holdings” and one of the members leaves during the expected lifespan of the activity? Such lifespan can be several decades for forestry activities, and there is no assurance that the group stays the same for such a long time.

In case of group assessment, the Delegated Act requires that the group is sufficiently homogenous to allow the evaluation of risks, that the members of the group have a durable relationship and participate in the activity and that the group remains the same for the subsequent audits. The Delegated Act does not provide that the group assessment cannot be continued in the situation where a holding leaves the group that had criteria assessed at group level. If the remaining group can be reasonably expected to continue their common assessment and if the profile of the group and its homogeneity are not affected, the group would not have any additional burden of proof regarding homogeneity and could continue to carry out the verification as a group. 

### In relation to the technical screening criteria for DNSH to climate change adaptation, what is the “expected life span” referred to in Appendix A for forestry activities?

The expected life span of forestry activities should be set at several tens of years at least. 

### In relation to the technical screening criteria for DNSH to climate change adaptation, can the climate projections prepared at State or regional level be used for the climate risk assessment?

The projections that are available at State and regional level could be used as a basis for assessments provided they are made by the relevant competent authority (e.g. weather forecast service). If more granular and specific assessments are available for some areas, the forest planners, owners or managers in these areas should also use these assessments.

### The biodiversity DNSH criteria of the activity “Forest management” in Section 1.3. require in point 6(a) to ensure the “good conservation status of habitat and species, maintenance of typical habitat species”. How should the term “good conservation status” in the DNSH criteria be interpreted?

The main aim of this criterion is to be applicable independently of whether the activity takes place in a protected area or not, or deals with priority species under the Birds and Habitats Directives or not. The first paragraphs in the criterion deal specifically with protected areas.

The text preceding point (a) which includes the reference to “good conservation status” makes clear the need for “ _provisions for maintaining and possibly enhancing biodiversity in accordance with national and local provisions_ ”. This indicates that the term _“good conservation status”_ as used in this criterion, can take different interpretations in accordance with national or local provisions, and was not intended as a reference to favourable conservation status as in the Birds and Habitats Directives.

### How can points (a) to (d) of the biodiversity DNSH criteria of the activity “Forest management” in Section 1.3. be ensured at a forest holding level?

The main aim of the criterion 6 _“Protection and restoration of biodiversity and ecosystems”_ is to ensure that, irrespective of whether the activity takes place in a conservation or protected forest area, detailed information specified in points (a) to (h) is provided in the forest management plan. 

In accordance with national or local provisions, a forest management plan or equivalent instrument defines the area in scope and the provisions for maintaining and possibly enhancing biodiversity that should be included in the management plan. 

### What does point (d) of the biodiversity DNSH criteria of the activity “Forest management” in Section 1.3. mean in practice when it refers to “improvement of physical, chemical and biological quality of the soil”?

Soil has physical, chemical, and biological components. The physical components of soil include the rocks and minerals that over time have turned into very small particles of sand, silt and clay. The chemical components of soil include the pH, the various nutrients (e.g. nitrogen) and water. Finally, the biological components of soil include the animals, plants, protozoa, bacteria and fungi that live in the soil.

In practice, improvement of the physical, chemical and biological components of the soil requires various techniques including those that avoid soil compaction, prevent soil erosion and runoff, and provide the right conditions for beneficial organisms to multiply in the soil, e.g. by leaving sufficient amounts of coarse and fine woody debris. 

### What does point (e) of the biodiversity DNSH criterion of the activity “Forest management” in Section 1.3. mean in practice when it refers to “promoting biodiversity-friendly practices that enhance forests’ natural processes”?

Forests are biologically diverse systems and offer a variety of habitats for plants, animals, fungi and micro-organisms. 

In practice, restoration and conservation of biodiversity and habitats in forests would require various practices that maintain and enhance structural complexity and promote natural dynamics adapted to local conditions. Some of these practices include for example setting areas aside, establishing buffer zones for waterbody protection, ensuring appropriate volume and diversity of deadwood and presence of habitat trees and other microhabitats, promoting natural regeneration and diversifying tree species and the age structure of the holding. Measures should be defined in a forest management plan or equivalent instrument in accordance with national or local provisions.

### What does point (f) of the biodiversity DNSH criterion of the activity “Forest management” in Section 1.3. mean in practice when it refers to “excluding the conversion of high-biodiverse ecosystems into less biodiverse ones”?

Forest ecosystems differ in terms of types of habitats, number of species and species diversity that they provide. 

The main aim of this criterion is to ensure that a high-biodiverse ecosystem retains its status and is not converted to a less biodiverse one, as a consequence of forest management practices. This can include conversion of the forest type by reducing the species diversity of trees, shrubs and herbaceous plants and the associated fauna, as well as the conversion of high-biodiverse non-forest ecosystems into less biodiverse forest ones. 

In practice, conservation of a high-biodiverse ecosystem would require various practices, adapted to local conditions. Some of these practices are defined by a forest management plan or equivalent instrument in accordance with national or local provisions.

### What does point (g) of the biodiversity DNSH criterion of the activity “Forest management” in Section 1.3. mean in practice when it refers to “ensuring the diversity of associated habitats and species linked to the forest”?

The main aim of this criterion is to ensure that, irrespective of whether the activity takes place in or outside a conservation or protected area, forests are managed in a way that ensures maintenance of diverse habitat types and species linked to the forest. 

In practice, ensuring diversity of habitats and species would require various practices, adapted to local conditions. Some of these practices include ensuring appropriate volume and diversity of deadwood, presence of tree-related microhabitats and creating or maintaining a diverse age-structure in the forest. They are defined by a forest management plan or equivalent instrument in accordance with national or local provisions.

### What does point (h) of the biodiversity DNSH criterion of the activity “Forest management” in Section 1.3. mean in practice when it refers to “ensuring the diversity of stand structures and maintenance or enhancing of mature stage stands and dead wood”?

“ _Conservation of a diverse stand structure_ ” and _“maintenance or enhancement of mature stage stands”_ means requiring the creation of more heterogeneous, irregular, mixed forests in height, diameter, age, and species, with a mix of denser and sparser parts according to the natural mix of species and structure and depending on the type of forest.

 _“Maintaining or enhancing deadwood”_ means leaving appropriate amounts of deadwood, taking into account local conditions, in the forest in all stages of decomposition, including standing dead and dying trees with actual or potential nesting and roosting cavities. This is an important measure for biodiversity restoration and conservation. 

### Do the manufacturing activities in Sections 3.1 to 3.6 include the manufacturing of components of its technologies?

In general, components can be counted if they are specified under the description of the activity or TSC. An example is the activity in Section _3.4. Manufacture of batteries_ , where the components are specified under the description of the activity. 

The treatment of key components for manufacturing activities, for example in the low carbon transport sector, covered by the Climate Delegated Act will be addressed in future revisions of the delegated act. 

### What information or document confirms the required emission limit values and demonstrate their compliance with DNSH criterion for pollution prevention and control (PPC) for the manufacturing activities in Sections 3.7, 3.8, 3.9, 3.10, 3.11, 3.12, 3.13, 3.14, 3.15, 3.16 and 3.17, if there is no obligation under Union legislation to have a permit to operate?

The DNSH criterion for pollution prevention and control (PPC) for the activities in Sections 3.7, 3.8, 3.9, 3.10, 3.11, 3.12, 3.13, 3.14, 3.15, 3.16 and 3.17 requires that the following applies to all activities regardless of their capacity: ‘ _Emissions are within or lower than the emission levels associated with the best available techniques (BAT-AEL) ranges laid down in the latest relevant best available techniques (BAT) conclusions, including the best available techniques (BAT) conclusions for (…).’_ As for the activities below the thresholds specified in Annex I of the Industrial Emissions Directive, there is no obligation under Union legislation to have a permit to operate.

Even if an installation does not meet the capacity thresholds under the Industrial Emissions Directive, it might, however, fall under the respective national environmental legislation and, therefore, be subject to an operating permit under that legislation. In any case, installations can demonstrate compliance by providing the independently verified emission levels for those polluting substances that are specified in the relevant implementing decisions on BAT. The monitoring of the emission levels should be according to these implementing decisions.

### How should the Taxonomy-alignment of passenger cars be assessed for cars that are not subject to the EU carbon emission test cycle (WLTP)?

To be classified as Taxonomy-aligned, an economic activity should fulfil the respective TSC for substantial contribution and DNSH and comply with the minimum safeguards.

The TSC for the activity “Manufacture of low carbon technologies for transport” in Section 3.3. for the environmental objective of climate change mitigation are as follows: 

_“The economic activity manufactures, repairs, maintains, retrofits, repurposes or upgrades: […]_

 _(f) vehicles of category M1 and N1 classified as light-duty vehicles with:_

 _(i) until 31 December 2025: specific emissions of CO2, as defined in Article 3(1), point (h), of Regulation (EU) 2019/631 of the European Parliament and of the Council, lower than 50gCO2/km (low- and zero-emission light-duty vehicles);_

 _(ii) from 1 January 2026: specific emissions of CO2, as defined in Article 3(1), point (h), of Regulation (EU) 2019/631, are zero;_

 _(g) vehicles of category L with tailpipe CO2 emissions equal to 0g CO2/km calculated in accordance with the emission test laid down in Regulation (EU) 168/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council_ ;

The Climate Delegated Act only refers to the EU regulations setting CO2 emission performance standards for new passenger cars and for new light commercial vehicles. The CO2 Regulation refers to the EU Emission Type Approval Regulation(51)Commission Regulation (EU) 2017/1151 of 1 June 2017 supplementing Regulation (EC) No 715/2007 of the European Parliament and of the Council on type-approval of motor vehicles with respect to emissions from light passenger and commercial vehicles (Euro 5 and Euro 6) and on access to vehicle repair and maintenance information, amending Directive 2007/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council, Commission Regulation (EC) No 692/2008 and Commission Regulation (EU) No 1230/2012 and repealing Commission Regulation (EC) No 692/2008 (OJ L 175, 7.7.2017, p. 1–643). which defines the test procedure (WLTP) for measuring the CO2 emissions of light-duty vehicles. The EU Taxonomy related disclosures comprise the global activities of EU companies, and they are not limited to EU turnover, CapEx and OpEx. Cars/vans produced/sold outside the EU are not necessarily tested under WLTP (not EU type approved passenger cars). The Climate Delegated Act does not contain any guidance on how to deal with such vehicles. 

Since the Taxonomy only sets values based on the WLTP test procedure, it does not provide specific rules for vehicles that are type-approved under other systems. While a large proportion of vehicles sold globally are registered in countries using type-approval systems based on WLTP, e.g. UNECE Regulation 154(52)See: https://unece.org/transport/documents/2021/02/standards/un-regulation-no-154-worldwide-harmonized-light-vehicles-test, and can therefore provide proof of compliance with this requirement, a still significant proportion of vehicles sold globally cannot provide proof of such compliance. Relevant certification procedures other than WLTP include the US CAFE, Japan’s JC08 or the NEDC (New European Driving Cycle, no longer in use in the EU but still applicable in some jurisdictions). For the purpose of proving compliance with this criterion, the manufacturing of vehicles certified under systems other than EU type approval and marketed in a third country can be considered as Taxonomy-aligned if the vehicle meets the Taxonomy criteria following the application of a duly documented and scientifically valid conversion factor.

### Can curtain walling be used to qualify for taxonomy-alignment under Section 3.5?

Yes, in the Delegated Act, _“curtain wall”_ can be understood as a _“non-load bearing wall”_ , in line with its use in (EN) ISO 12631, which covers both opaque and non-opaque elements. We recognise the proposed U-value for walling systems might be very difficult to meet by curtain walls that are fully (or almost fully) glazed. 

The latter (fully or almost fully glazed walls) could qualify as window products under the respective U-value. In principle, for fully (or almost fully) glazed and transparent curtain walls, i.e. those for which at least 80% of the surface is glazed and transparent, it is necessary to apply the proposed U-value for windows. 

### What does “highest two populated classes” for household appliances referred to in the TSC in Section 3.5. and, where applicable, the TSC in Section 7.3. mean in practice? What household appliances fall under these classes? Could the EPREL database be used to obtain the information?

The requirement targets the two highest classes of energy efficiency that are populated, in which at least some products are on the market. To understand which classes are the highest populated in which at least some products are on the market, an overview of the available products on the market (based on official data) is provided by a reference database named EPREL (European Product Database for Energy Labelling)(53)See: https://eprel.ec.europa.eu/screen/home. 

### How should “substantial” be defined in the substantial contribution criteria of the activity “Manufacture of other low carbon technologies” in Section 3.6.in that refer to “substantial life-cycle GHG emission savings”? Which data should be used as evidence for the comparison?

As the activity in Section 3.6 of Annex I refers to other low carbon technologies not covered in Sections 3.1 to 3.5, the TSC can refer to several activities across a range of sectors. Their precise application leaves some flexibility and depends on the activity in question. Consequently, there is no common performance level implied by the criterion of _"substantial life-cycle GHG emission savings compared to the best performing alternative technology/product/solution available on the market"_. Operators of the activity should justify whether and how their technology enables the achievement of substantial GHG reductions in other sectors compared to other competing technologies. In this, they should ensure that their assessment is consistent with any credible, available external sources of information on the potential of the technology to help achieve decarbonisation of the target activity, in line with the EU Climate Law or Paris Agreement objectives. Undertakings should also demonstrate this element for the purpose of the third-party verification required by the TSC and, notably undertakings subject to Article 8 of the Taxonomy Regulation, should disclose all relevant information as part of their non-financial statement. 

### Does the product or service intended to qualify as Taxonomy-aligned under Section 3.6. have to constitute an economically viable solution?

The rule referred to in the TSC is a requirement to demonstrate that the relevant products/services are better performing than the best available solution on the market, regardless of whether the relevant products/services are economically viable or scalable/available at industrial scale. 

### For instance, can the manufacturing of equipment for traffic management and tolling be considered as Taxonomy-eligible under the activity “Manufacture of other low carbon technologies” in Section 3.6.?

The activity could be eligible under Section 3.6. of Annex I. For the purpose of Taxonomy-alignment, the activity would have to prove that it delivers GHG emissions savings compared to the best performing alternative technology/product/solution available on the market (in this case, compared to other equipment for traffic management and tolling). If there are several possible uses, savings would have to occur for all potential uses. 

For an indicative guide on the types of activities that could qualify under the Delegated Act based on the different industry classification systems, one may consider consulting the ‘ _NACE alternate classification mapping’_ published by the Platform on Sustainable Finance(54)See: <https://ec.europa.eu/info/files/sustainable-finance-taxonomy-nace-alternate-classification-mapping_en>. It is to be noted that this document is not binding, but indicative. 

### How to apply the concept of “essential use for society” for DNSH on pollution prevention and control for activity “Manufacture of other low carbon technologies” in Section 3.6.?

Reference is made to the replies in Section III below on DNSH regarding [Appendix C](./assets/documents/None Appendix C.pdf).

### Are the technical screening criteria of the activity “Manufacture of aluminium” regarding indirect greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions fulfilled only if 100% of renewable energy is used in the manufacture of aluminium or does the electricity user need to document the carbon intensity of indirect GHG emissions (for example by purchasing Guarantees of Origin)?

Until 2025, operators are required to comply with only two out of the three conditions set out in point (a) of the TSC for substantial contribution to climate change mitigation in Section 3.8. in order to be considered as substantially contributing to that objective. 

After 2025, all three conditions laid out in Section 3.8 of Annex I should be met in order for the activity to be considered as substantially contributing to the climate change mitigation. The requirement regarding indirect GHG emissions is that the average carbon intensity for the indirect GHG emissions does not exceed 100g CO2e/kWh. By analogy to the 100gCO2e/kWh threshold for substantial contribution in certain energy sectors, this requirement does, therefore, not mean that only renewable energy may be used to comply with this criterion. 

### How should the provisions in the technical screening criteria of the activity “Manufacture of iron and steel” in Section 3.9 referring to the attribution of emissions for the production and use of waste gases be interpreted?

The criteria for the manufacture of iron and steel referred to in point (a) of the TSC for substantial contribution to climate change mitigation in Section 3.9. specify that GHG emissions should be _“reduced by the amount of emissions assigned to the production of waste gases in accordance with point 10.1.5(a) of Annex VII to Regulation (EU) 2019/331”._ This means that the emissions attributed to the production of waste gases are not taken into consideration for the purpose of the criteria for steel laid out in the Climate Delegated Act. Notably, the requirement means that manufacturers of steel can calculate the emission attributed to the production of waste gases according to the free allocation rules (which consider these waste gases explicitly). However, for the purpose of compliance with the TSC, they are discounted. The calculation of the activity’s emissions does therefore not take into account these emissions attributed to the generation of waste gases. 

### How are the GHG emission thresholds specified in the technical screening criteria of the activity “Manufacture of iron and steel” in Section 3.9. applied? For example, does the manufacture of hot metal (1,331 tCO2e/t product) include the provision of coke (0,144 tCO2e/t product) or is the GHG emission threshold to be applied exclusively for the hot metal manufacturing process step?

The definitions of the processes and emissions covered by the different screening criteria (i.e. system boundaries) are given in Annex I to Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2019/331. The production of coke is not included in the system boundaries of hot metal.

### What is the definition of “hot metal” as included in the substantial contribution criteria of the activity “Manufacture of iron and steel” in Section 3.9.?

Annex I to Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2019/331 defines the product hot metal and the related product benchmark and system boundaries.

### How is the emission threshold for hydrogen used in different processes for the manufacture of hydrogen under Section 3.10?

The Climate Delegated Act recognises hydrogen as an energy carrier, storage solution, fuel or feedstock. In line with the technology-neutrality requirement referred to in point (a) of Article 19(1) of the Taxonomy Regulation, the manufacture of hydrogen is not restricted to specific production pathways or technology. Any production of hydrogen that demonstrates meeting the life-cycle GHG emission savings of 73.4% in comparison to the fossil fuel comparator of 94gCO2e/MJ in analogy with Article 25(2) and Annex V of RED II can be considered substantially contributing to climate change mitigation.

In line with the approach taken for defining DNSH to climate change mitigation, the Climate Delegated Act draws on the level of ambition of existing Union legislation. Annex II sets out that the production of hydrogen is considered not doing significant harm, if it achieves at least the GHG emission savings level enshrined in RED II.

### Does the reference to RED II in the technical screening criteria of the activity “Manufacture of hydrogen” in Section 3.10. imply that the RED II additionality requirement applies?

The Climate Delegated Act does not include requirements for additionality. However, this matter is relevant in the context of the implementation of RED II and may affect the types of hydrogen that qualify as renewable (i.e. the type of electricity can be considered renewable for the production of hydrogen) and may also be relevant for determining the GHG emission intensity of renewable hydrogen.  

### How are the life cycle emissions assessed and calculated for the activity “Manufacture of hydrogen” in Section 3.10.? For example, is the manufacture of the equipment taken into account when assessing life cycle emissions?

The Climate Delegated Act sets out the relative GHG emission savings requirement in comparison to the fossil fuel comparator by analogy with Article 25(2) and Annex V of RED II.

Similar to the approach pursued for electricity and heat generation activities, the Climate Delegated Act enables the use of alternative methodologies to calculate life-cycle GHG emissions. In line with ISO standards, the alternative calculation methodology in case of hydrogen production is the one referred to in Article 28(5) of RED II. 

The Commission is preparing a delegated act setting out a methodology for determining the GHG emissions savings of renewable fuels of non-biological origin and recycled carbon fuels, which includes renewable hydrogen (except hydrogen derived from biogenic sources) and certain types of low carbon hydrogen. 

### For the activity “Electricity generation from hydropower” in Section 4.5., what does the power density threshold of the electricity generation facility above 5 W/m2 mean in practice?

Power density of hydropower plants describes the relation between the installed capacity of the power production and impounded area. According to the International Hydropower Association’s GHG emission data(55)International Hydropower Association, Hydropower Status Report 2018. See p.29. of Sector trends and insights available at: https://hydropower-assets.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/publications-docs/iha_2018_hydropower_status_report_4.pdf, hydropower plants above 5W/m2 do not emit more than 100gCO2e/kWh. This finding has been used to exempt power plants with a higher power density from having to carry out the life-cycle assessment (along with run-of-river plants).

### What does “where relevant” in the criteria for DNSH to sustainable use and protection of water and marine resources of the activity “Electricity generation from hydropower” in Section 4.5. mean in practice and who assesses what measures are relevant?

The DNSH criteria for hydropower list all possible (generic) mitigation measures which must be considered in all cases. However, the implementation of these criteria for hydropower is context specific. The objective is to strike a balance between, on the one hand, to protect ecosystems and water bodies, and, on the other hand, avoiding putting an excessive administrative burden on hydropower operators. Therefore, in an individual case, a specific analysis should be performed based on the list of all measures to identify those that are appropriate. Only measures that are relevant to the ecological conditions of the project should be implemented.

The relevance of specific DNSH criteria and mitigation measures listed therein will depend on a case-by-case assessment in terms of feasibility and relevance, taking into account the broader hydro-morphological context, including the state of the ecological flow and the requirement to attain and maintain a good ecological status, or where applicable good ecological potential, of the relevant water bodies. The reference conditions for good status or good potential for water bodies differ according to the relevant ecoregion (geographical area identified in Annex XI of the Water Framework Directive). These conditions are relevant for determining the necessary and relevant mitigation measures aimed at achieving these objectives.

### What is meant by the ‘compensatory measures’ in point 3.5 of the DNSH criteria for sustainable use and protection of water and marine resources of the activity “Electricity generation from hydropower” in Section 4.5.? What examples of these measures could be provided?

Compensatory measures are measures to restore continuity within the same river basin district to an extent that compensates the disruption of continuity and associated impacts on aquatic ecosystems caused by the hydropower development for which compliance with TSC is claimed, for example, by removing dams or other barriers elsewhere in the river basin district. Environmental benefits stemming from the compensatory measures are proportionate to the extent of the impacts. The relevance and type of such compensatory measures are not further detailed since they require a case-by-case assessment in terms of feasibility and relevance.

### Is there an absolute requirement that hydropower production should allow for reaching the objectives of good status or good potential of water bodies, for both new and existing hydropower production, in order to fulfil the DNSH-criteria for sustainable use and protection of water and marine resources?

There is an absolute requirement to put in place all technically and ecologically relevant measures towards achieving good ecological status or good ecological potential of water bodies in line with the definition of the Water Framework Directive. For both new and existing hydropower production the DNSH criterion for sustainable use and protection of water and marine resources provides that: _“In accordance with Directive 2000/60/EC and in particular Articles 4 and 11 of that Directive, all technically feasible and ecologically relevant mitigation measures have been implemented to reduce adverse impacts on water as well as on protected habitats and species directly dependent on water”_ and _“The effectiveness of those measures is monitored in the context of the authorisation or permit setting out the conditions aimed at achieving good status or potential of the affected water body.”_

In addition, for new hydropower production, it is indicated that _“The plant does not permanently compromise the achievement of good status/potential in any of the water bodies in the same river basin district.” (point 3.4. of Section 4.5.)_

###  The Delegated Act requires that hydropower operates in accordance with an authorisation or permit aimed at achieving good status or potential of the affected water body. Does that mean that: i. there is an absolute requirement that all hydropower production require a permit/licence/authorisation; and ii. all licenses/permits/authorisations should refer to the environmental objectives for the affected water bodies? Does this also mean that the DNSH-criteria require creating conditions aimed at achieving good status or potential of the affected water body?

All hydropower production requires a permit/licence/authorisation aiming at achieving good ecological status or good ecological potential of the affected water body in line with the definitions of the Water Framework Directive. In addition, as provided in point 2.3 of Section 4.5. of the DNSH to sustainable use and protection of water and marine resources, _“the effectiveness of those measures is monitored in the context of the authorisation or permit setting out the conditions aimed at achieving good status or potential of the affected water body.”_

###  Can hydropower production implying the application of Article 4(5) of the Water Framework Directive (WFD) (less stringent objectives) be considered to fulfil the DNSH criteria?

In principle, a body of water affected by a hydropower plant would have been converted into a _‘heavily modified water body’_ in accordance with Article 4(3) WFD. That implies that it should strive towards reaching good ecological potential rather than good status. According to the WFD, derogations under Article 4(5) WFD could apply if a water body is affected by hydropower and it would be disproportionately costly or technically impossible to achieve good potential. Should such a plant nevertheless decide to apply all technically possible and ecologically relevant mitigation measures to reach good ecological potential, and be subject to a permit to monitor and control those ecologically relevant measures, it may still fulfil the DNSH criteria.

This would however imply that the water body would aim towards good status or good potential and, therefore, that the derogation under Article 4(5) WFD should be reviewed at the next revision of the relevant river basin management plan. A water body, which on the contrary would remain under the (initial) ‘lowered’ objective under Article 4(5) of WFD without putting in place the necessary measures (ecologically and technically relevant) towards good potential, does not fulfil the DNSH criteria.

### How should the best available techniques (BAT-AEL) ranges referenced in the technical screening criteria of the activity “Electricity generation from renewable non-fossil gaseous and liquid fuels” in Section 4.7. be applied in non-EU jurisdictions?

BAT-AEL ranges could be applied internationally since the ranges are not based on EU legislation. BAT-AELs describe a range of emission levels obtained under normal operating conditions using a best alternative technique (BAT) or a combination of best alternative techniques as described in BAT conclusions. They are expressed as an average over a given period of time under specified reference conditions.

### The emissions from a plant can vary based on the fuel it uses. Do the criteria for the activity “Transmission and distribution of electricity” in Section 4.9. imply a requirement to prove that emissions stay under 100g CO2/kWh, independent of the fuel used?

The emission intensity of newly enabled generation capacities as well as the average system grid emission factor are based on historical emissions and power generation. The 100gCO2/kWh applies to this historical data, on a rolling five-year period.

### Is hydrogen included as part of the activity “Storage of electricity” in Section 4.10?

Storage of hydrogen is included in Section 4.12 of Annex I as a distinct activity with its own criteria for substantial contribution to climate change mitigation and for DNSH.

The storage of hydrogen is considered as making a substantial contribution to climate change mitigation if it consists in the construction of new or conversion of existing storage dedicated to hydrogen, or if it consists in the operation of storage when the hydrogen stored is produced in line with the respective criteria defined for the manufacture of hydrogen.

### How are low-carbon gases defined in the context of the activity “Manufacture of biogas and biofuels for use in transport and of bioliquids” in Section 4.13.? Is biogas covered by any of the criteria?

The Climate Delegated Act does not include a definition of renewable and low carbon gases. All relevant gases, including biogas (as indicated in the title and the description of the activity), meeting the relevant TSC should be considered as renewable and low-carbon gases.

### The description of the activity “Transmission and distribution networks for renewable and low-carbon gases” in Section 4.14. includes renewable and low-carbon gases, while the criteria for substantial contribution to climate change mitigation do not refer to renewable gases. How should this be understood?

The Climate Delegated Act does not include a definition of renewable and low carbon gases. All gases meeting the relevant TSC should be considered as renewable and low-carbon gases. 

### Would the construction of hydrogen pipelines referenced in the activity “Transmission and distribution networks for renewable and low-carbon gases” in Section 4.14. only qualify where that hydrogen is manufactured with the hydrogen threshold under the Activity in Section 3.10. “Manufacture of hydrogen”?

No, there is no direct link between the two activities. It might be that a “guarantee for hydrogen” might exist in the future as the hydrogen market develops, with improved traceability. Under the TEN-E Regulation which identifies trans-European energy infrastructure priorities, hydrogen infrastructure ‘Projects of Common Interest’ need to demonstrate that they contribute significantly to sustainability, including by reducing greenhouse gas emissions, by enhancing the deployment of renewable or low-carbon hydrogen, with an emphasis on hydrogen from renewable sources. 

### Can the use of dry sludge from a non-industrial urban water treatment plant (without prior digestion and without mixing) be considered as biomass? If considered as biomass, would an incineration facility with energy recovery in the form of electricity and heat, dedicated exclusively to the burning of this sludge be Taxonomy-eligible?

According to the definition of biomass in Article 2(24) of RED II, biomass is defined as _‘the biodegradable fraction of products, waste and residues from biological origin from agriculture, including vegetal and animal substances, from forestry and related industries, including fisheries and aquaculture, as well as the biodegradable fraction of waste, including industrial and municipal waste of biological origin.’_ According to this definition, dry sludge from a non-industrial urban water treatment plan can be considered biomass.

However, from the perspective of classifying activities as ‘environmentally sustainable’, the Taxonomy Regulation specifically states in its Article 17(1)(d) that any _‘activity that leads to a significant increase in the generation, incineration or disposal of waste, with the exception of the incineration of non-recyclable hazardous waste’_ is considered to cause significant harm to the environment.

On this basis, Article 17(1)(d) of the EU Taxonomy Regulation applies to measures related to both incineration and co-incineration of waste, notably in waste-to-energy plants and cement plants, and measures related to the construction of new such plants, increasing existing capacities or extending their lifetime. Thus, these activities - with the exception of the incineration of non-recyclable hazardous waste – cannot meet the TSC. This would include an incineration facility with energy recovery in the form of electricity and heat, dedicated exclusively to the burning of dry sludge from a non-industrial urban water treatment plant.

### Is the manufacture of equipment for commercial and residential pools (e.g. skimmers, inlets, filters, pH regulators, chlorine regulators, valves) Taxonomy-eligible under the activities “Construction, extension and operation of water collection, treatment and supply systems” in Section 5.1. or “Construction, extension and operation of waste water collection and treatment” in Section 5.3.?

Sections 5.1 and 5.3 of the Climate Delegated Act are targeted at the delivery of drinking water and the treatment of waste water. Therefore, in order to qualify as making a substantial contribution to climate change mitigation under the Taxonomy Regulation, the designers/operators of a drinking water/waste water system are responsible for ensuring that the system meets the technical screening criteria set out in Sections 5.1. and 5.3 of Annex I.

Manufacture of products for commercial and residential pools would not qualify under the Sections 5.1 and 5.3 of Annex I as their main purpose does not contribute to delivering drinking water or ensuring the treatment of waste water.

### Can the anaerobic digestion of sewage sludge also be included in the net energy consumption referenced in the technical screening criteria for the activity “Construction, extension and operation of waste water collection and treatment” in Section 5.3. if it is within the treatment plant?

As specified in the substantial contribution criteria in point 1 of Section 5.3. _“Net energy consumption of the operation of the waste water treatment plant may take into account […] as appropriate, energy generation within the system (such as hydraulic, solar, thermal and wind energy).”_ The list specified is a non-exhaustive list. 

The energy generated through anaerobic digestion of sewage sludge falls within the scope of energy generation within the system, even if not explicitly mentioned.

### Does the activity “Material recovery from non-hazardous waste” in Section 5.9. also cover sorting facilities where final recycling or recovery is carried out in a different facility or country?

The activity does not cover pure sorting facilities. Instead, it covers those facilities that carry out recycling of separately collected waste, whereas part of the process is often an initial ‘sorting’ step, e.g. to separate plastics and metals in case of co-mingled separately collected waste, or to separate different types of plastics such as PET, HDPE, PP. 

The Climate Delegated Act prioritises the material recovery aspect as this has the greater potential to reduce GHG emissions, i.e. by replacing virgin material in production. 

### For the activity “Transport of CO2” in Section 5.11, can the installation of assets that increase the flexibility and improve the management of an existing network be considered in their own right or does such an installation have to be an integral part of the transport of captured CO2?

No, complying with a single element of the substantial contribution criteria to climate change mitigation does not imply Taxonomy-alignment. The criteria are cumulative and all criteria should be complied with. 

### What does “the highest populated classes” based on an official dataset mean regarding tyres?

The technical screening criteria target the two highest classes for rolling resistance (influencing energy efficiency) that are populated, in which at least some tyres are on the market. To understand which classes are the highest populated in which at least some tyres are on the market, an overview of the available products on the market (based on official data) is provided by a reference database named EPREL (European Product Database for Energy Labelling). Public information on tyres is available from https://eprel.ec.europa.eu/screen/product/tyres. For instance, for severe snow conditions tyres for vans with size 195R15C, the highest performing tyres in rolling resistance (energy efficiency) are ranked class D (at the time of writing). 

### Are “the highest populated classes” of tyres determined by dimension or categories?

The highest populated classes should be determined for the specific tyre dimension and properties (the tyres that could be actually fitted on the vehicle, and including the three peak mountains snowflake (![](data:image/png;base64,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)) pictogram if use of the vehicle is for severe snow conditions).  The information can be checked in the EPREL. The class for a whole category would be meaningless, as the class for the same brand and model can change based on the tyre size: for every different size, classes for rolling resistance coefficient, wet grip and noise can be different.

### Is comparison of tyre Fuel Efficiency, Wet Grip and Rolling Noise classes done across all tyres or separately within tyre categories, e.g. winter, all-season, and summer tyres?

Comparison is done within a specific tyre category, meaning tyre size and certified special properties. Tyres with the three peak mountains snowflake (![](data:image/png;base64,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)) pictogram can be specifically selected (those that are also for ice can be selected). Beyond this, distinctions do not exist for “winter” “all-season” or “summer” (however, arguably a tyre marketed “all-season” but without the three peak mountains snowflake pictogram would not have sufficient performance in severe snow conditions). For example tyres of size “205/55 R16” from the same brand and with the same tread design (thus same seasonality as well) may have different classes for the 3 parameters depending on the speed category index or other aspects (e.g. specifically designed for an original equipment manufacturer (OEM) or another OEM). All necessary parameters (size designation, load capacity index, speed category, season) have to be entered in EPREL for a correct comparison of the selected tyres.

### Do the tyre screening criteria for M and N vehicles apply to the whole European market or are there country-specific criteria?

The tyre technical screening criteria for M and N vehicles derive from an EU regulation and as such apply to the European market, with no country-specific variation. As for any criteria in the delegated act, compliance with these criteria would also be required for activities taking place outside of the EU. C1, C2 and C3 tyres are registered with the tyre class indicated.

### Is the substantial contribution criterion for climate change mitigation in Sections 6.2, 6.6, 6.8, 6.9, 6.10, 6.12, 6.14, 6.15, 6.16. and 6.17 of Annex I to be understood that the wagons or vessels and the fuel distribution infrastructure cannot be intended to be exclusively used for the transport or storage of fossil fuels?

While applying this criterion to exclude assets, operations and infrastructure that are dedicated to the transport of fossil fuels, it is necessary to take into account the multiple uses, different ownerships, user arrangements and fuels blending rates, in line with the relevant existing market practices. The consideration should inter alia include the type of mobile asset or infrastructure under consideration and their other uses, including whether it is intended to be used also for transport and storage of low-carbon alternatives.

For example, for maritime transport, whilst it is possible to clearly identify crude oil tankers as exclusively providing for the fossil fuel market, the same cannot be assumed for product, chemical tankers, or vessels carrying dry bulk products. The latter are vessel types which can be used for the transport of non-fossil fuel products and should not be excluded outright. 

Depending on the planned use and context, relevant existing market practices referred to in recital (35) of the Climate Delegated Act could be for example those used by the European Investment Bank(56)For project finance, in the context of the ambitious climate assessment. Dedicated is defined as built and acquired with the explicit intention to predominantly transport or store fossil fuels over the life of the project. or by Climate Bonds Initiative(57)Dedicated is defined by transport mode, e.g. in case more than 25% of the freight in t-km transported by the line is comprised of fossil fuels or more than 25% of the rolling stock is dedicated to the transport of fossil fuels or 25% of tonnage transported annually is fossil fuels (threshold declines geometrically at 5.3% from the year 2020 onwards). See: https://www.climatebonds.net/files/files/CBI%20Transport%20Criteria%20document_Aug2022%281%29.pdf also: https://www.climatebonds.net/files/files/standards/Waterborne%20Transport%20%28Shipping%29/CBI%20Certification%20-%20Shipping%20Criteria%20V1b%2020211215.pdf and: https://www.climatebonds.net/files/files/CBI Transport Criteria document_Jan2020(1).pdf. For example, in the case of _freight rail transport_ in Section 6.2., universal wagons that are acquired specifically for the transport of coal would fail to meet the criterion of not being dedicated to the transport of fossil fuels. 

In all cases, turnover derived from transporting fossil fuels by assets that are not dedicated to the transport of fossil fuels should be excluded from the numerator of the turnover KPI under the Disclosures Delegated Act.

### Is ammonia considered as a zero direct (tailpipe) CO2 emission fuel?

Ammonia (NH3) is by definition carbon-free and it does not emit any CO2 emissions when combusted or used in a fuel cell. It can therefore be considered as a zero direct (tailpipe) CO2 emission fuel.

It is however important to note that, when ammonia is used together with hydrocarbon oil fuels used for piloting/ignition, namely in marine internal combustion engines, there will be an associated presence of CO2 emissions derived from multi-fuel combustion process.

### Do particularly low CO2 diesel locomotives classify as transitional technology in the description of the activities “Passenger interurban rail transport” in Section 6.1. and “Freight transport” in Section 6.2.?

The Climate Delegated Act does not classify technologies. According to the criteria in Sections 6.1 and 6.2 of Annex I that define substantial contribution to climate change mitigation, for any locomotive to qualify, it should be able to operate on zero direct tailpipe CO2 emissions. Any locomotive producing emissions, including low CO2 emissions, that does not comply with the requirement for having zero tailpipe CO2 emissions when operated on a track with necessary infrastructure (i.e. that is not bi-mode) does not therefore comply with the criteria. Bi-mode locomotives which have zero tailpipe emissions when operated on electrified tracks but can be run on diesel where tracks are not electrified qualify as a transitional activity. 

### What type of train would be able to be classified as a transitional technology in the activity “Passenger interurban rail transport” in Section 6.1.?

The Climate Delegated Act does not classify technologies. For the purposes of classifying economic activities under the EU Taxonomy, activities that comply with the substantial contribution criteria in point 1.b, as well as with the DNSH criteria, would be considered transitional activities, as set out in the description of the activity in Section 6.1 of Annex I. 

Bi-mode locomotives which have zero tailpipe emissions when operated on electrified tracks but can be run on diesel where tracks are not electrified qualify as a transitional activity.

### For the activity “Freight rail transport” in Section 6.2., is there a threshold for what proportion of the operating time a train can be operated with a conventional engine, e.g. 80% of the operating time on rails with required infrastructure and a maximum of 20% of the operating time with conventional engine?

The Climate Delegated Act does not set such thresholds. To comply with the TSC, the trains can use a conventional engine only where the infrastructure allowing for zero direct tailpipe CO2 emission is not available. 

### What else, apart from current-carrying infrastructure, is meant by "track with necessary infrastructure" as referenced in the substantial contribution criteria of activities “Passenger interurban rail transport” in Section 6.1. and “Freight rail transport” in Section 6.2.?

The necessary infrastructure referred to in the substantial contribution criteria point (1.b) in Sections 6.1 and 6.2 of Annex I (reference to bi-mode rolling stock) refers to tracks that are electrified. 

### Regarding the DNSH criteria to circular economy in the activity “Freight rail transport” in Section 6.2., when exactly is compliance with the waste hierarchy reached? Are there any percentage requirements?

There are no percentage requirements. The DNSH criteria to circular economy for “freight rail transport” in Section 6.2. simply require to demonstrate that measures are in place to ensure that waste treatment options higher up the waste hierarchy, as set out in Article 4 of the Waste Framework Directive, are preferred. 

### Regarding the DNSH criteria to pollution prevention and control of the activity “Freight rail transport” in Section 6.2., for engines for the propulsion of railway locomotives (RLL) and engines for the propulsion of railcars (RLR) complying with emission limits set out in Annex II to Regulation (EU) 2016/1628 , can it be generally considered that engines with zero CO2 emissions comply with the emission limits?

Yes, it can generally be considered that engines such as RLL and RLR with zero CO2 emission comply with the emission limits under the DNSH criteria for freight rail transport (Section 6.2).

### What are some concrete use cases of the activity “Operation of personal mobility devices, cycle logistics” in Section 6.4.? For example, are mail carts pulled by postmen included in the scope (where the propulsion comes from the physical activity of the user)?

The activity in Section 6.4. _“Operation of personal mobility devices, cycle logistics”_ includes the _“selling, purchasing, leasing, renting and operation of personal mobility or transport devices where the propulsion comes from the physical activity of the user, from a zero-emissions motor, or a mix of zero-emissions motor and physical activity. This includes the provision of freight transport services by (cargo) bicycles.”_

A mail cart may be seen as a similar transport device as a cargo bike (which is explicitly mentioned in the description of the activity) as it:

\- has the primary aim of transporting an item from one point to another, and;

\- the propulsion comes solely from the physical activity of the user. 

### Why is there a different application date for vehicles of category N1 in the activity “Transport by motorbikes, passenger cars and commercial vehicles” in Section 6.5. than in the activity “Freight transport services by road” in Section 6.6.?

The transition period for vehicles of category N1 in Section 6.5. takes into account the specificities and current state-of-technology of passenger cars and of light commercial vehicles in Section 6.5, which differ for freight transport vehicles in Section 6.6. 

### Vehicle category N1 (classified as vehicle for good transport) is covered in the activity “Transport by motorbikes, passenger cars and light commercial vehicles” in Section 6.5., as well as in the activity “Freight transport services by road” in Section 6.6. Why is N1 covered in both activities? What are the differences?

Vehicle category N1 are vans, i.e. motor vehicles designed and constructed primarily for the carriage of goods with a maximum mass under 3.5 tons. However, their emissions can be regulated under two different regimes, depending on the “reference mass” of the vehicles concerned. In most cases, vehicles with a reference mass of less than 2610 kg, have to follow the ”light-duty vehicle” type approval rules (for CO2 and pollutant emissions – Euro 6 Regulation (EC) No 715/2007) which also apply for cars and are subject to the CO2 fleet standards. N1 vehicles with a reference mass exceeding 2610 kg normally have to follow the “heavy-duty vehicle” emission type approval rules (Euro VI Regulation (EC) No 595/2009) and are generally not subject to CO standards. 

For this reason, the description in Activity in Section 6.6 is as follows: “ _Purchase, financing, leasing, rental and operation of vehicles designated as category N1, N2 (240) or N3 (241) falling under the scope of EURO VI (242), step E or its successor, for freight transport services by road._ ” In this way, all vehicles type-approved with the light duty framework (cars and vans with a reference mass below 2610 kg) will be covered in Section 6.5, while some N.1 (vans that use the above mention derogation) will be covered in Section 6.6.

### For the activities “Transport by motorbikes, passenger cars and commercial vehicles” in Section 6.5. and “Freight transport services by road” in Section 6.6., should M1 and N1 vehicles have a reference mass not exceeding 2610 kg in order to be Taxonomy-aligned?

N1 vehicles either fall under the provisions of Section 6.5 or Section 6.6 of Annex I, depending on whether they fall under the provisions of Euro 6 (Regulation (EC) No 715/2007) or the provisions of Euro VI (Regulation (EC) No 595/2009), therefore different mass thresholds apply. The scope of application of those Regulations is determined by the reference mass of the vehicles concerned.

M1 vehicles fall only under the provisions of Section 6.5 (passenger cars and light commercial vehicles), referring to Euro 6 (Regulation (EC) No 715/2007) and thus covering only vehicles with a reference mass not exceeding 2 610 kg. 

### For the activity “Inland freight water transport” in Section 6.8., are there any categories/classes for individual rivers for individual operation categories?

The TSC for inland freight water transport in the Climate Delegated Act do not address questions related to possible additional categories or classes. 

### How is the “overall trading pattern of the vessel” in footnote 245 referred to in Section 6.8. of Annex I defined?

As noted in footnote 245 in Section 6.8 of Annex I, the guidance on how to calculate this indicator is provided in the document MEPC.1/Circ. 684 from IMO.

### What is the definition used for the Energy Efficiency Operational Indicator in the activity “inland freight waterway transport” in Section 6.8.?

Footnote 245 in Section 6.8 of Annex I sets out the definition used for the Energy Efficiency Operational Indicator. It is defined as the ratio of mass of CO2 emitted per unit of transport work. This is a representative value of the energy efficiency of the ship operation over a consistent period which represents the overall trading pattern of the vessel. Guidance on how to calculate this indicator is provided in the document MEPC.1/Circ. 684 from IMO.

### Who will calculate the Energy Efficiency Operational Indicator?

The operator of the activity reporting Taxonomy-alignment should obtain the information needed for reporting. 

### Is the “best in class” exception for transitional activities referred to in the activity “Inland freight water transport” in Section 6.8. limited to 2025 for water transport vessels?

The Climate Delegated Act limits the recognition of certain transitional activities for water transport until 2025. 

### What does “able to run on fuels from renewable sources” mean?

This means that a vessel can use renewable or low carbon fuels. Fuels that meet the TSC specified in Sections 3.10 and 4.13 of Annex I. 

### What is the scope of “chartering” with or without a crew as referred to in the activity “Sea and coastal freight water transport, vessels for port operations and auxiliary activities” in Section 6.10.?

The Delegated Act does not define chartering. However, this is a well-established terminology in commercial shipping practice, used by all major organisations, such as the International Chamber of Shipping (ICS) or the Baltic and International Maritime Council (BIMCO). 

Ship chartering is the hiring out of a ship by a ship owner to another company, the charterer, for the transportation of goods over a limited and well-defined period of time. 

The two main parties in ship chartering are the ship owner and the charterer. Other parties can include the ship broker who negotiates deals between ship owners and charterers, the shipping agent who takes care of the essential in-port details and the ship manager, who takes care of operating and crewing the vessel on behalf of the owner for a fee.

The charter party, i.e. the contract, defines the rate, duration, and terms agreed between the ship owner and the charterer. Many different types of charter contracts exist in practice: 

  *     * Voyage Charter - basic hiring of a vessel and its crew for a voyage between the port of loading and the port of discharge known as a voyage charter. In this type of contract, the ship owner is paid by the charterer either on a per-ton basis, or as a lump sum. Port costs, with the exception of stevedoring, fuel costs, and the crew costs are paid by the owner, and payment for the use of the vessel is known as freight.
    * Time Charter - hiring of a vessel for a specific period of time, where the owner still manages the ship, but the charterer selects the ports, decides the routing, and has full operational control of the vessel for the duration of the contract. It pays the fuel costs, port charges, cargo handling costs, commissions, and a daily hire fee.
    * Bareboat Charter – chartering arrangement where charterer has full control of the vessel. Apart from the capital cost of building the vessel, which is the owner’s responsibility, all other costs including fuel, crew, port charges and insurance, are paid by the charterer. The legal and financial responsibility for the vessel rests with the charterer.



### How is alignment with the technical screening criteria of the activity “Sea and coastal freight water transport, vessels for port operations and auxiliary activities” in Section 6.10. demonstrated by undertakings chartering or operating vessels?

The demonstration of Taxonomy-alignment by undertakings chartering or operating vessels should be made on a basis of the relevant provisions in the chartering contract.

Such demonstration could typically be the responsibility of the undertaking that was granted financing based on Taxonomy-alignment, in accordance with the relevant TSC. If this was granted to the owner of the ship, then the relevant responsibility of the charterer, or operator, would be to present all the information on fuel purchased to the owner, who has responsibility vis-à-vis the financing institution. If, on the other hand, the financing was provided to the charterer, to cover OpEx, then the relevant responsibility to demonstrate Taxonomy-alignment, would be on the charterer directly towards the financing institution.

As regards the mandatory disclosures pursuant to the Disclosures Delegated Act, the undertaking that generates revenues and/or incurs CapEx and/or OpEx related to this activity should assess their Taxonomy-eligibility and Taxonomy-alignment and report this in its KPIs.

### What is the “best in class” criterion referred to in the activity “Sea and coastal freight water transport, vessels for port operations and auxiliary activities” in Section 6.10. covering?

Given that for shipping technologically and economically feasible low-carbon alternatives are not yet commercially available, it qualifies as a transitional activity referred to in Article 10(2) of the Taxonomy Regulation. The “best in class” __ criterion in this context captures that a compliant ship: (a) has greenhouse gas emission levels that correspond to the best performance in the sector; (b) does not hamper the development and deployment of low-carbon alternatives; and (c) does not lead to a lock-in of carbon-intensive assets.

The “best in class” criterion accordingly allows certain vessels to comply with the substantial contribution criteria even though the vessels do not have zero direct CO2 tailpipe emissions until the end of 2025. This is particularly the case in paragraph 1(d) of Section 6.10., according to which the vessels need to have attained an EEDI value 10% below the EEDI requirements applicable on 1 April 2022. The vessels have to be able to run on zero direct (tailpipe) CO2 emission fuels or on fuels from renewable sources (that meet the technical screening criteria specified in Sections 3.10 and 4.13 of Annex I), to prove that there is no lock-in of carbon-intensive assets.

### For the activity “Sea and coastal freight water transport, vessels for port operations and auxiliary activities” in Section 6.10., does a vessel have to run on zero direct emission fuels or on fuels from renewable sources in order to be Taxonomy-aligned, or is it sufficient that the vessel is certified for fuels from renewable sources such as biofuels?

The substantial contribution criteria in Section 6.10. of Annex I specify four alternative ways to demonstrate compliance. In particular, for the criterion specified in point (1.d), a vessel, having an attained Energy Efficiency Design Index (EEDI) value 10% below the EEDI requirements applicable on 1 April 2022, should be able to _inter alia_ run on zero CO2 emission or renewable fuels that comply with the criteria in Section 3.10 “Hydrogen and h2-based synthetic fuels” or in Section 4.13 “Manufacture of biogas and biofuels for use in transport and of bioliquids” of Annex I. 

The attained EEDI reference is the main criterion in this point (1.d) in Section 6.10 of Annex I. The ability to run on zero direct CO2 emission or renewable fuels represents an enabling provision in the criterion which does not impose, or further specify, which type of fuel to be used. 

Furthermore, the criterion does not impose further limitation on the use of different types of fuels during operation. In practice, the verification of the enabling condition is made with reference to the energy conversion system installed on board, rather than the fuel used.

As an example, a vessel equipped with dual fuel gas engines is able to use liquefied natural gas (LNG), but would also be “able to use” either liquefied bio or synthetic methane. 

Thus, for compliance with the TSC, it is sufficient that the vessel meets the minimum EEDI requirements and is equipped and certified with energy conversion systems able to run with fuels that comply with the criteria in Section 3.10. or 4.13.

### Are vessels operated with biofuels included in the zero tailpipe CO2 emission criterion of the activity “Sea and coastal freight water transport, vessels for port operations and auxiliary activities” (Section 6.10.)?

No, they are not. The reference to zero direct tailpipe emissions in the TSC does not prejudge the type of fuel selected. Internal combustion engines, whether using biofuels or other, have, as a rule, direct CO2 emissions, whether associated to the main fuel used or to piloting fuels used for ignition. Any vessel with such emissions does not comply with the requirement for having zero tailpipe CO2 emissions. Also, fuel cell installations, if using fuel other than hydrogen or ammonia will have CO2 emissions associated to the fuel reforming process.

Zero direct tailpipe emissions must be demonstrated based on the technological choices made for the propulsion installation.

Without considering the possibility of on-board carbon capture and storage (OCCS) the only possible options for zero tailpipe CO2 emissions would be technological solutions, such as:

  *     * Electric ships, operated on an all-electrical configuration, with energy stored in batteries;
    * Hydrogen Fuel Cell installations, with hydrogen or hydrogen carrier as source of energy;
    * Ammonia Fuel Cell installations, with ammonia as source of energy;
    * different combinations of renewable energy sources, directly used in propulsion assistance (e.g. wind assisted propulsion) or as energy source for electricity production (wind generators or photovoltaic).



### How can the Energy Efficiency Design Index (EEDI) be applied in the activity “Sea and coastal freight water transport, vessels for port operations and auxiliary activities” in Section 6.10. under points (c) and (d) if the ship is outside the scope of EEDI?

A ship can be outside the scope of EEDI when:

  *     * it is not meeting the relevant size and deadweight provisions in MARPOL Annex VI, Chapter 4, regulations 19 and 24, respectively;
    * it is not being part of the ship types covered by EEDI (MARPOL Annex VI, Chapter 4, regulation 24).



According to footnote 261 of Annex I, vessels that fall into the ship types set out in MARPOL Annex VI Regulation 2, but are not considered as new ships under that Regulation may provide attained EEDI value calculated on a voluntary basis in line with MARPOL Annex VI Chapter 4 and have those calculations verified in line with MARPOL Annex VI, Chapter 2.

For any ship outside the group of ship types considered for EEDI calculation, irrespective of the size or deadweight, it is not possible to apply EEDI methodology and, therefore, only the applicable criteria of (1.a) and (1.b) of Section 6.10 of Annex I would apply.

Finally, and, in particular, for vessels of smaller size and deadweight, it is very likely that the adoption of all electrical solutions or hydrogen fuel cell systems may be adopted. EEDI would not work in such cases and the applicable criteria for such vessels are included in points (1.a) and (1.b) of Section 6.10 of Annex I.

### Why does the point 1(c) of the substantial contribution criteria of the activity “Sea and coastal freight water transport, vessels for port operations and auxiliary activities” in Section 6.10. refer to a reference value applicable to heavy duty vehicles? How is it relevant for shipping? What is the actual value of this reference?

As set out in the Impact Assessment of the Climate Delegated Act, this criterion is designed to incentivise a modal shift from road to more sustainable modes. The criterion therefore uses a comparison between land and maritime emissions. Until 31 December 2025, are considered as compliant with TSC operations which:

  *     * are designed to enable modal shift of freight transport from land to sea, and 
    * their emissions are half of those defined for heavy duty vehicle sub-group 5-LH.



The data for the average reference CO2 emissions value defined for heavy duty vehicles in accordance with Article 11 of Regulation 2019/1242 can be found in Commission Implementing Decision (EU) 2021/781. The CO2 emissions reference value for vehicle sub-group 5-LH is 56.60 gCO2/tkm. 

### For the activity “Sea and coastal passenger water transport” in Section 6.11., which criteria apply to vessels that carry both passenger and freight?

Vessels that carry both freight and passengers can apply either the criteria set out in the freight section or those set out in the passenger section. In any case, the criteria are broadly the same except for 1(c) incentivising modal shift.

### Is airport infrastructure dedicated to the provision of rail-air multimodal services for the airport’s passengers and cargo covered in activity “Infrastructure for rail transport” in Section 6.14.?

As long as the activity corresponds to the activity description of Section 6.14 _“Infrastructure for rail transport”_ of Annex I, the installations at or linked to airports would be eligible, notably where _“the infrastructure and installations are dedicated to the transfer of passengers from rail to rail or from other modes to rail”_ as well as “ _the infrastructure and installations are dedicated to transhipping freight between the modes: terminal infrastructure and superstructures for loading, unloading and transhipment of goods_ ”.

### Does the activity “Infrastructure enabling low-carbon road transport and public transport” in Section 6.15. include infrastructure dedicated to the urban transport carried out by air, such as infrastructure dedicated to operate an electric vertical take-off and landing (eVTOL) vehicle with zero tailpipe CO2 emissions, for the purpose of urban transport of passengers and goods? Does it include intelligent transport systems (ITS) enabling for example traffic flow optimisation and facilitation of energy efficiency in road transport?

In order to be regarded as included in Section 6.15 of Annex I, infrastructure must either be dedicated to the operation of road vehicles with zero tailpipe CO2 emissions, or be dedicated to urban and suburban public passenger transport, i.e. regular passenger transport services of general economic interest provided to the public on a non-discriminatory and continuous basis. This would include, for example, bus and metro lines, but not a taxi service. 

Infrastructure dedicated to urban transport carried out by air can therefore only be regarded as included in Section 6.15 of Annex I if the service provided is urban public passenger transport open to the public on a non-discriminatory and continuous basis.

 _‘Intelligent transport system’_ activities could be eligible engineering and technical consultancy services under Section 6.15 of Annex I, when they consist in systems enabling connected and automated multimodal mobility of passengers, traffic flow optimisation, congestion reduction, facilitation of energy efficiency in road transport, and/or electronic tolling systems.

### Regarding the preparation of construction site waste for recycling (DNSH to circular economy), can it be assumed that compliance with national law and any applicable threshold values is sufficient for a construction activity to be Taxonomy-aligned?

In the DNSH criteria for circular economy for the activity _“Construction of new Buildings_ ” in Section 7.1., non-hazardous construction and demolition waste generated on construction sites for new buildings and major renovations shall be prepared for reuse, recycling and other material recovery, including backfilling operations using waste as a substitute for other materials, in at least 70 percent of the masses generated. The TSC require that the specific threshold for the reuse, recycling, and other material recovery construction and demolition waste applies on the construction site. This means that this threshold has to be reached per specific project and cannot necessarily be considered fulfilled merely by complying with the relevant threshold values in national legislation (i.e. the transposition of the Waste Framework Directive). Reference is also made to the ‘EU Construction and Demolition Waste Management Protocol’, in the form of non-binding guidelines.(58)See: https://single-market-economy.ec.europa.eu/news/eu-construction-and-demolition-waste-protocol-2018-09-18_en

### How can non-EU real estate assets be classified as Taxonomy-aligned? How are building standards (LEED, BREEAM, DGNB) treated in the EU Taxonomy? Is there any way to demonstrate that a LEED or BREEAM building is Taxonomy-aligned?

The standards mentioned are not explicitly considered in the Climate Delegated Act. Where they can help demonstrating compliance with the TSC, they can be accepted for the purpose of compliance with the TSC.

### As of today many Energy Performance Certificates (EPC) in some Member States are based on energy consumption rather than energy demand. Can these consumption-based energy certificates be used as an equal basis to prove Taxonomy-alignment?

If it is an officially produced EPC, it can be accepted, and used on equal terms. 

### What are the actual Nearly Zero-Energy Buildings (NZEB) thresholds in each Member State (region)?

This information can be obtained from national authorities. Any new building in the EU should have an Energy Performance Certificate (EPC), and the EPC indicates the relevant value for the respective building and how it compares to reference values, such as NZEB.

### For the activity “Construction of new buildings” in Section 7.1., is the date of submission of the building application decisive for the technical screening criteria to be applied?

Yes, the date of submission of the complete application is the relevant date for deciding which TSC apply at that point in time. 

### Is the scope of the activity “Construction of new buildings” in Section 7.1. only limited to companies constructing the new buildings or also companies, which commission the construction of buildings (e.g. car manufacturing company which contract a construction company to build an office building)?

This applies to both construction companies and entities that commission a new building. However, the way they can claim relevant turnover/CapEx/OpEx as Taxonomy-eligible/aligned may differ, and for the entity owning the building it is also possible to use the relevant criteria in Section 7.7. of Annex I.

### For the activity “Construction of new buildings” in Section 7.1., do the requirements regarding air-tightness, thermal integrity measurement and life-cycle Global Warming Potential (GWP) apply to non-residential buildings?

Yes, the proposed TSC regarding air-tightness, thermal integrity measurement and life-cycle Global Warming Potential (GWP) do not differentiate between residential and non-residential buildings and thus apply to both. 

### For residential buildings, can compliance with the technical screening criteria of the activity “Construction of new buildings” in Section 7.1. be demonstrated by using a limited sub-set of apartment units, instead of checking compliance for the whole property? Does this possibility also apply in non-residential buildings?

For the energy threshold, this depends on national regulations, i.e. if the EPC applies to the whole building, or to each apartment. Whichever is the requirement at national level, it should apply for both residential and non-residential buildings. The correct EPC will be provided in any case, in line with the national regulations. For identical apartments, having normally identical EPCs, a limited sub-set can be used. However, if there are different types of apartments, with different EPCs, all types need to be checked.

For the specific TSC for buildings larger than 5000 m2, the compliance with the requirements that ‘ _the building resulting from the construction undergoes testing for air-tightness and thermal integrity’_ and _‘the life-cycle Global Warming Potential (GWP) of the building resulting from the construction has been calculated for each stage in the life cycle and is disclosed to investors and clients on demand’_ should be proven for the building (not for apartments), for both residential and non-residential buildings. 

### Regarding the proof of thermal integrity measurement, what should be done with buildings that are completed or handed over outside the required heating period? Can proof of thermal integrity measurement only be provided after the building has been handed over and, until then, be recorded as a declaration of intent by those responsible in accordance with EU law?

Yes, the proof can be provided later, if it is not possible to perform the necessary tests before the building is handed over.

### Regarding the determination of the life-cycle Global Warming Potential (GWP) as referenced in the activity “Construction of new buildings” in Section 7.1.: i. What is the process to be followed if individual phases of the life cycle (such as: Phase C - disposal of the building; but in particular Phase D - benefits and pressures outside the system boundary) are currently not available in the form of corresponding (product-specific) environmental indicators according to EN 15978 / EN 15804 (in particular GWP) in the form of robust product databases at national level? In this case, can "partial conformity or conformity based on national framework conditions" be assumed by naming the parts of the life cycle considered (for example: phase A, phase B; parts of phase C)? ii. What is the process if, apart from possible restrictions of the overall assessment approach, the availability of reliable environmental indicators for the technical building equipment cannot be included in the balancing, or only to a very limited extent? In this case, can "partial conformity or conformity on the basis of national framework conditions" be assumed by mentioning this restriction? iii. Are nationally established assessment procedures permitted for proof of conformity if they currently have the limitations, but at the same time are largely established in practice (for example, in building assessment systems, in the allocation of housing subsidies)?

As specified in footnote 286 of Annex I, the GWP is communicated as a numeric indicator for each life cycle stage expressed as kgCO2e/m2 (of useful internal floor area) averaged for one year of a reference study period of 50 years. The data selection, scenario definition and calculations are carried out in accordance with EN 15978 (EN 15978:2011. Sustainability of construction works. Assessment of environmental performance of buildings. Calculation method). The scope of building elements and technical equipment is as defined in the Level(s) common EU framework for indicator 1.2. 

Where a national calculation tool exists, or is required for making disclosures or for obtaining building permits, the respective tool may be used to provide the required disclosure. Other calculation tools may be used if they fulfil the minimum criteria set out by the Level(s) common EU framework(59)<https://susproc.jrc.ec.europa.eu/product-bureau/product-groups/412/documents>, see indicator 1.2 user manual. 

### Is dedicated building land for the new construction of buildings no longer considered arable and cultivated land, regardless of the soil fertility of the land that is still undeveloped? Or is it generally prohibited in the sense of the ordinance to construct a new building on arable and cultivated land with medium to high soil fertility and subsurface biodiversity, regardless of its dedication under building law?

The purpose of including the DNSH criterion for the protection and restoration of biodiversity and ecosystems is to ensure that new construction does no significant harm to land types that have a high biodiversity and ecosystem value. More specifically, their purpose is that the three land types identified by the DNSH criterion are not converted to land for construction purposes.

On this basis, any project involving new construction on arable land and crop land with a moderate to high level of soil fertility and below ground biodiversity is considered to do significant harm to biodiversity and ecosystems.

### For the activity “Construction of new buildings” in Section 7.1., is building land awaiting development, dedicated but still undeveloped building land generally excluded from development according to the EU Taxonomy?

The purpose of including the DNSH criterion for the protection and restoration of biodiversity and ecosystems is to ensure that new construction complies with the criteria set out in [Appendix D](./assets/documents/None Appendix D.pdf) and does no significant harm to land types that have a high biodiversity and ecosystems value. More specifically, it aims to ensure that the three land types identified by the DNSH criterion are not converted to land used for new construction.

On this basis, every type of land – with the exclusion of the land types in points (a), (b) and (c) under point (6) – is considered suitable to fulfil the DNSH criterion for biodiversity and ecosystems. Therefore, building land awaiting development, dedicated but still underdeveloped building land, may fulfil the DNSH criterion for biodiversity and ecosystems.

### Point 1 of the substantial contribution criteria of the activity “Construction of new buildings” in Section 7.1. provides that “the Primary Energy Demand (…) is at least 10 % lower than the threshold set for the nearly zero-energy building (…) in national measures implementing Directive 2010/31/EU (…)”. Where national legislation related to Energy Performance of Buildings Directive and the NZEB concept has recently changed, should compliance with this criterion be performed using the legislation applicable at the time of the building licensing (the old one) or the legislation currently in force?

The TSC applicable at the time of the building permit should be used (i.e. the date of the complete application for receiving the building permit). 

### The substantial contribution criteria of the activity “Construction of new buildings” in Section 7.1. indicate that the energy performance is certified using an ‘as built Energy Performance Certificate (EPC)’. What is meant by ‘as built’? Can during the construction phase a calculated estimated primary energy demand (PED) be used to determine Taxonomy-alignment until the final energy performance assessment has been performed? If during the construction phase the calculated estimated PED value is only available on building level and not on individual building unit level (which is often the case for apartments), can the PED value for the total building be used as a proxy for the PED of the individual apartment during the construction phase?

For new buildings, either an EPC (valid for 10 years) or an EPC as-built are valid. It is understood that often for construction projects the loan is provided before the works start and funds are made available as the works progress. Since it is not possible to obtain the EPC as-built until the very end of the project, it should be possible as a provisional measure to obtain and use an EPC as-designed. This would allow the building process to start. However, upon completion of the works, there needs to be an EPC as-built to certify that indeed the building complied with the criterion 10% better than NZEB.

This depends also on the availability of the EPCs and the scope of the project as such. When the project concerns a whole building, there is no need to check the EPC for each individual apartment. When the project is about construction or acquisition/ownership of an apartment, the EPC for the respective apartment can be used. 

### Paragraph 2 of the substantial contribution criteria of the activity “Construction of new buildings” in Section 7.1. states that ‘as an alternative, where robust and traceable quality control processes are in place during the construction process this is acceptable as an alternative to thermal integrity testing’. What quality process qualifies as a traceable quality control process and, therefore, guarantees compliance with this criterion?

Certification of construction or of installation companies in the respective field qualify. 

### In Annex II to the Delegated Act, the DNSH criteria to climate change mitigation of the activity “Construction of new buildings” in Section 7.1. of Annex II provide that "The building is not dedicated to extraction, storage, transport or manufacture of fossil fuels." Is this to be interpreted as excluding the operation of fossil fuel systems?

The criterion for DNSH to mitigation in Section 7.1. of Annex II means to exclude as Taxonomy-aligned the adaptation activities for buildings that are dedicated to certain activities involving fossil fuels. This criterion does not exclude from fulfilling the DNSH criterion buildings where small quantities of fuels might need to be stored or transported, e.g. for ensuring the functioning of the on-site energy production facilities, but where the building is dedicated to a completely different use (for example, residential building).

### The DNSH criteria to pollution prevention and control of the activity “Construction of new buildings” in Section 7.1. provide that: ‘Building components and materials used in the building renovation that may come into contact with occupiers emit less than 0,06 mg of formaldehyde per m³ of material or component upon testing in accordance with the conditions specified in Annex XVII to Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006 and less than 0,001 mg of other categories 1A and 1B carcinogenic volatile organic compounds per m³ of material or component, upon testing in accordance with CEN/EN 16516 or ISO 16000-3:2011 or other equivalent standardised test conditions and determination methods.’ - Annex XVII to REACH does not specify conditions to determine formaldehyde emissions. What testing methodology needs to be performed: specific standard or a test method such as EN 16516? Why does the criteria refer to “0,06 mg of formaldehyde per m³ of material or component” when formaldehyde emission are expressed as air concentration?

As regards point 1, the reference to REACH Annex XVII is appropriate, as it is under revision for formaldehyde and the revised version will include provisions regarding methods for testing emissions of formaldehyde. We expect that the new restriction of formaldehyde and formaldehyde releasing substances will be added to REACH Annex XVII and will be published in Q2 2023. 

 

As regards point 2, the reference is meant to refer to m³ of chamber air in the test system. The formulation could be corrected in the review of the Delegated Act.  

### The DNSH to pollution prevention and control of the activity “Construction of new buildings” in Section 7.1. require compliance with the criteria set out in Appendix C. Is compliance with Appendix C already ensured by complying with Union legislation referred in the DNSH criteria for Section 7.1. or should other matters be taken in consideration?

Full compliance with the legislation mentioned in [Appendix C](./assets/documents/None Appendix C.pdf) (i.e. Regulations (EU) 2019/1021, 2017/852, 2009/1005, 1907/2006 and Directive 2011/65/EU) is not sufficient for fulfilling the generic criteria for DNSH to pollution prevention and control regarding use and presence of chemicals specified in [Appendix C](./assets/documents/None Appendix C.pdf). The reference to EU legislation in that [Appendix i](./assets/documents/None Appendix i.pdf)dentifies substances in the scope of the generic DNSH criteria. The requirements that need to be fulfilled as regards these chemicals are specified in the [Appendix C](./assets/documents/None Appendix C.pdf) itself.   

### Construction of buildings implies the use of thousands of substances/products stemming from a very wide range of suppliers, which themselves integrate components from third parties. The bulk of information to be gathered can be very difficult to collect. Is there a methodology or path of compliance that can be indicated to ensure compliance with Appendix C?

All conditions set out in [Appendix C](./assets/documents/None Appendix C.pdf), i.e. points (a) to (g), apply whenever a reference is made to [Appendix C](./assets/documents/None Appendix C.pdf). 

No simplified list of substances is available for construction products and building components. Nevertheless, the substances covered by points (a) to (e) of the DNSH criteria are listed in the relevant provisions of the respective regulations referenced.  

The list of substances covered by point (f) are available by consulting the candidate list of substances of very high concern managed by the European Chemicals Agency pursuant to Article 59(10) of the REACH Regulation. The candidate list is available on-line.52  

Substances covered by point (g) can be found in several sources, depending on the particular paragraph of REACH Art 57 they belong to:

As regards REACH Art. 57(a-c): one source is the classification and labelling inventory managed by the European Chemical Agency pursuant to Article 42 of the CLP Regulation. The inventory provides information on the hazard classifications of substances, which can be compared with the criteria laid down in Article 57 (a)-(c) of REACH. The inventory lists substances with harmonised classifications (assessed and concluded by authorities) as well as self-classifications (assessed and concluded by industry itself). The classification and labelling inventory is available on-line at: C&L Inventory – ECHA on europa.eu

As regards REACH Art. 57(d-f): The hazard categories mentioned in this paragraph are not yet covered by the C&L Inventory. ECHA manages lists of substances under assessment by its informal ECHA Expert Groups. The lists provide an indication of substances that might meet the criteria laid down in Article 57 (d)-(f) of REACH as well as substances that likely do not meet the criteria or substances under assessment. The persistency, bioaccumulation and toxicity (PBT) assessment list provides information on those properties of substances, which can be compared with the criteria laid down in Article 57 (d)-(e) of REACH. The inventory is available on-line at: <https://echa.europa.eu/pbt>. 

The endocrine disruptor (ED) assessment list provides information on those properties of substances, which can be compared with the criteria laid down in Article 57 (f) of REACH. The inventory is available on-line at: https://echa.europa.eu/ed-assessment. 

In line with the Chemicals Strategy for Sustainability commitment, the Commission is preparing inclusion of new hazard classes (including PBTs, vPvBs and EDs) in the CLP Regulation (EC) No 1272/2008. If and when the hazard classes are included in the CLP Regulation, the C&L Inventory will gradually include information on the hazard classifications of substances covered by the point (g) in [Appendix C](./assets/documents/None Appendix C.pdf). 

### The DNSH criterion for pollution prevention and control of the activity “Construction of new buildings” in Section 7.1. requires that “Where the new construction is located on a potentially contaminated site (brownfield site), the site has been subject to an investigation for potential contaminants, for example using standard ISO 18400”. If contamination is detected, should decontamination be implemented to comply with this criterion? Which thresholds should be considered to define if a site is contaminated? Is there any international reference or are national/local references to be used?

The purpose of the criterion is to require, prior to the construction of a new building or a real estate project, the investigation of contaminants on a potentially contaminated site. This includes the investigation of sites where potentially contaminating risk activities took place, or sites where the presence of soil contamination is suspected (e.g. after an accident or calamity). The criterion requires that the investigation is aimed at collecting the necessary information for the confirmation of the presence of soil contamination and the determination of a risk assessment. Once the risk assessment is undertaken, the requirements of the criteria are met.

A contaminated site is determined on a case-by-case basis after soil investigation and soil sampling (for instance, following the guidance of standard ISO 18400). Currently, there are no common EU thresholds to evaluate whether or not a site is contaminated. Most Member States have national legislation in place to tackle soil contamination, which in some cases include specific limit values and requirements for the investigation, sampling, risk assessment and remediation.

### The DNSH criteria for water and marine resources of the activity “Construction of new buildings” in Section 7.1. explicitly exclude "installations in residential building units" from the scope of the requirements. How is that to be understood? Is this a general exemption for residential buildings?

Residential building units are single-family homes or flats in multi-flat buildings. These have been excluded from the DNSH criteria to minimise the administrative burden on individual homeowners and associated construction or renovation projects.

However, multi-flat or multi-home developments by a single economic operator are covered by the DNSH criteria for water and marine resources. Therefore, the criteria do not provide a general exemption for residential buildings.

### The DNSH for water and marine resources of the activity “Construction of new buildings” in Section 7.1. state that ‘WCs, including suites, bowls and flushing cisterns, have a full flush volume of a maximum of 6 litres and a maximum average flush volume of 3,5 litres’. How shall the maximum average flush be calculated? Is the BREEAM methodology applicable?

The Building Research Establishment Environmental Assessment Method (BREEAM), or equivalent instrument, applies to calculate the maximum average flush for WCs, including suites, bowls, and flushing cisterns. 

### For the DNSH criterion to circular economy for the activity “Construction of new buildings” in Section 7.1., is it acceptable that material prepared for energy recovery (incineration) can be counted towards the requirement that 70% of the non-hazardous construction and demolition waste generated on the construction site is prepared for reuse, recycling and other material recovery? Or should incineration/waste be considered outside the 70%?

The purpose of including the DNSH criterion to the objective on the transition to a circular economy is to require that 70% (by weight) of the non-hazardous construction and demolition waste generated on the construction site is prepared for reuse, recycling and other material recovery, including backfilling operations using waste to substitute other material.

Under Article 17(1)(d) of the Taxonomy Regulation, economic activities leading to a significant increase in the generation, incineration or disposal of waste, with the exception of the incineration of non-recyclable hazardous waste, should be considered to significantly harm the circular economy.

On this basis, the use of non-hazardous construction and demolition waste that would significantly increase incineration must be considered to harm the circular economy and does therefore not count towards the 70% threshold (by weight).

### What degree of adherence to the ISO 20887 or other standards for assessing the disassembly or adaptability of buildings needs to be demonstrated to ensure compliance with the DNSH to circular economy criterion of the activity “Construction of new buildings” in Section 7.1.? How will compliance with this requirement be evaluated/audited by the responsible authority?

The purpose of including the DNSH criterion for the transition to a circular economy is to demonstrate that, when a building is designed and constructed, this is done in a way to enable reuse and recycling of the materials used. 

The DNHS criterion does not qualify the degree to which adherence with the ISO 20887 or other standards for assessing the disassembly or adaptability of buildings has to be demonstrated. To ensure compliance with TSC, a relevant set of measures needs to be put in place by the construction company to demonstrate that a new building is more (a) resource efficient, (b) adaptable, (c) flexible and (d) dismantlable compared to the average new built building. 

### Which elements should be provided to prove that the new construction is not built on one of the sites referred in the criteria for DNSH to biodiversity for the activity “Construction of new buildings” in Section 7.1. (e.g. arable land or high in biodiversity)?

The purpose of including the DNSH criterion for the protection and restoration of biodiversity and ecosystems is to ensure that new construction complies with the criteria set out in [Appendix D](./assets/documents/None Appendix D.pdf) and does no significant harm to land types that have a high biodiversity and ecosystems value. More specifically, this implies that the three land types identified by the DNSH criterion are not converted to land used for new construction. 

On this basis, the building permit can be used as proof of compliance to show that new construction is not built on the land types in points (a), (b) and (c) of the criterion. 

### How should it be demonstrated that a new construction does not fall under point a) of the criterion for DNSH to biodiversity of the activity “Construction of new buildings” in Section 7.1., if for that piece of land soil fertility is still under research at EU level and below ground biodiversity maps have not yet been published?

The purpose of inclusion of the criterion (a) under DNSH to the biodiversity objective for the construction of new buildings is to rule out that buildings on fertile arable or cropland (or any of the other categories of land as covered in points (b) and (c)) would be considered environmentally sustainable, due to the negative environmental impact of using such land.

It should be noted that if according to the applicable laws and spatial planning regime it would be allowed or permitted by the authorities to build on the parcel of land, this DNSH criterion is always met. So, the provisions here are most relevant in places with no clear zoning/planning law. 

### How should the DNSH to biodiversity criterion for the activity “Construction of new buildings” in Section 7.1., which states ‘An Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) or screening has been completed in accordance with Directive 2011/92/EU’, be understood?

According to the criteria on the ‘Construction of new buildings’, real estate projects fall under Annex II of the Environmental Impact Assessment Directive and are subject to a screening. In each Member State, the competent authority decides whether for such projects an Environmental Impact Assessment is deemed necessary. Such a decision is based on a screening procedure that determines whether projects shall be subject to an assessment either on the basis of thresholds/criteria, or on the basis of a case-by-case examination taking into account the relevant selection criteria set out in Annex III of the Directive.

In order to ensure a high level of protection of the environment and human health, screening procedures and environmental impact assessments should take account of the impact of the whole project in question, including, where relevant, its subsurface and underground, during the construction, operational and, where relevant, demolition phases.

Further guidance on the implementation of the EIAD can be found on https://environment.ec.europa.eu/law-and-governance/environmental-assessments/environmental-impact-assessment_en 

### For the activity “Renovation of existing buildings” in Section 7.2., what is the definition of major renovation in each Member State?

According to Article 2(1)(10) of the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive, “ _major renovation”_ means the renovation of a building where: 

(a) the total cost of the renovation relating to the building envelope or the technical building systems is higher than 25 % of the value of the building, excluding the value of the land upon which the building is situated; or 

(b) more than 25 % of the surface of the building envelope undergoes renovation. 

Member States may choose to apply option (a) or (b) or both. The information can be checked with the Member State concerned. 

### Footnote 299 in Annex I Section 7.2. on “Renovation of existing buildings” specifies that "the reduction of the net primary energy demand of energy from renewable sources shall not be taken into account". How is this to be interpreted?

The footnote referred to indicates that: “ _The initial primary energy demand and the estimated improvement is based on a detailed building survey, an energy audit conducted by an accredited independent expert or any other transparent and proportionate method, and validated through an Energy Performance Certificate (EPC). The 30 % improvement results from an actual reduction in primary energy demand (where the reductions in net primary energy demand through renewable energy sources are not taken into account), and can be achieved through a succession of measures within a maximum of three years”_. 

It follows that the reductions in the primary energy demand are to be validated by an EPC, and should be estimated based on the methodology applicable, in line with the provisions of the Energy Performance for Buildings Directive. The directive clarifies that ‘primary energy’ means energy from renewable and non-renewable sources which has not undergone any conversion or transformation process. 

Improving the energy source to use renewable energy can qualify under Section 7.6. – “Installation, maintenance and repair of renewable energy technologies”. 

### How can undertakings meet the DNSH criterion for water of the activity “Renovation of existing buildings” in Section 7.2. as long as there are no corresponding legal restrictions or manufacturer specifications and thus no data exist with which one could track compliance?

The DNSH criterion for the sustainable use and protection of water and marine resources aims at limiting water use for the specified water appliances installed as part of the renovation works in non-residential building units. The appliances include (a) wash hand basin taps and kitchen taps; (b) showers; (c) WCs, and (d) urinals.

On this basis, compliance with the specific water use can be undertaken based on either of these elements: (a) product datasheets, (b) a building certification, and (c) an existing product label in the Union, such as the EU Ecolabel.

### To determine whether or not a 30% reduction in Primary Energy Demand (PED) will be/has been achieved, a starting-PED-value and an end-PED-value needs to be determined. Does the term “validated through an Energy Performance Certificate” as included in the technical screening criteria of the activity “Renovation of existing buildings” in Section 7.2. mean that the end-PED-value is only valid / acceptable if it is a PED value as included in a new EPC? Is the preceding sentence (‘is based on a detailed building survey, an energy audit conducted by an accredited independent expert or any other transparent and proportionate method’) also applicable to the end- PED-value (post-renovation PED value)?

The calculation of reduction should be based on the values in an EPC before and after the renovation, based on the numeric indicators in kWh/m2 indicated in the EPC.

### For the activity “Renovation of existing buildings” in Section 7.2., does the wording ‘is based on a detailed building survey, an energy audit conducted by an accredited independent expert or any other transparent and proportionate method’ mean that to determine the starting Primary Energy Demand (PED) value in addition to an on-site measurement of the PED, alternative methods are acceptable as long as they are ‘transparent and proportionate’? Would it be acceptable to determine (e.g. by using property characteristics and year of construction) upper and lower estimated PED-values for existing energy labels and use the upper PED-values as the starting-PED-value to determine the starting point of a renovation?

Where an Energy Performance Certificate (EPC) is not available or cannot be generated, the initial primary energy demand and the estimated improvement can be based on a detailed building survey, an energy audit conducted by an accredited independent expert or any other transparent and proportionate method. The 30 % improvement should result from an actual reduction in primary energy demand (where the reductions in net primary energy demand through renewable energy sources are not taken into account), and can be achieved through a succession of measures within a maximum of three years.

### For the activity “Renovation of existing buildings” in Section 7.2., can all renovation measures taken during a three-year period be counted to determine if the 30% reduction (compared to the starting-PED-value as at the beginning of the three-year period) has been realised?

Yes.

### What are the technical specifications of energy efficient windows, doors, light sources, and highly efficient HWAC technologies referred to in points (b) to (e) of the activity “Installation, maintenance and repair of energy efficiency equipment” in Section 7.3.?

These specifications are defined at national level. 

### What is the technical specification of heat pumps contributing to targets for renewable energy in heat and cool in accordance with RED II?

Annex VII of RED II (Accounting energy from heat pumps) states that “ _only heat pumps for which SPF > 1,15 * 1/η shall be taken into account_”, where:

  *  _“SPF = the estimated average seasonal performance factor for those heat pumps_
  *  _η = the ratio between total gross production of electricity and the primary energy consumption for the production of electricity and shall be calculated as an EU average based on Eurostat data.”_



###  How to distinguish the installation of heat pumps referred to in Section 4.16. (“Installation and operation of electric heat pumps”) from those in Section 7.6. (“Installation, maintenance and repair of renewable energy technologies”)? What does installation ‘on-site’ mean? Can you provide examples?

Section 7.6 covers the installation, maintenance, repair and upgrade of heat pumps and the ancillary technical equipment, if installed on-site as technical building systems. A heat pump installed on-site to provide heating for a specific building is covered by Section 7.6. 

Section 4.16 covers the installation and operation of other types of electric heat pumps, which are not installed on-site as technical building systems (e.g. industrial heat pumps, heat pumps installed as part of a district heating system).

### Are bioenergy and hydropower eligible under the activity “Installation, maintenance and repair of renewable energy technologies” in Section 7.6.?

The renewable energy technologies included in Section 7.6 are the ones likely to be installed on-site, and for which an assessment has been performed, concluding that they contribute substantially to climate change mitigation, and do not cause significant harm to any other environmental objective. The list provided in Section 7.6 of the Climate Delegated Act is exhaustive. Therefore, hydropower and bioenergy are not covered by this section. Additional technologies could be included in the future, subject to a more detailed assessment.

### How do the Sections 4.3 (“Electricity generation from wind power”) and 7.6 (“Installation, maintenance and repair of renewable energy technologies”) interact when it comes to the construction or operation of electricity generation facilities that produce electricity from wind power and the installation, maintenance and repair of wind turbines? Which activities are to be allocated to activity 7.6?

Section 7.6 covers installation, maintenance and repair of wind turbines and the ancillary technical equipment, if installed on-site as technical building systems. A wind turbine installed on-site to provide electricity for a specific building is covered by Section 7.6. 

Section 4.3 covers the construction or operation of electricity generation facilities that produce electricity from wind power in all other situations, when the wind turbines are not installed on-site as technical building systems.

### Do the technical screening criteria of the activity “Acquisition and ownership of buildings” in Section 7.7. relate exclusively to residential buildings or also to non-residential buildings?

The criteria related to the energy performance of the building apply to both residential and non-residential buildings. For the non-residential building there is an additional requirement (not applicable to residential buildings): _“Where the building is a large non-residential building (with an effective rated output for heating systems, systems for combined space heating and ventilation, air-conditioning systems or systems for combined air-conditioning and ventilation of over 290 kW) it is efficiently operated through energy performance monitoring and assessment.”_

###  The substantial contribution criteria of the activity “Acquisition and ownership of buildings” in Section 7.7. state that ‘For buildings built after 31 December 2020, the building meets the criteria specified in Section 7.1 of this Annex that are relevant at the time of the acquisition’. Does this refer both to the substantial contribution and DNSH criteria of Section 7.1 (“Construction of new buildings”)?

As this text is included under the substantial contribution criteria, and there are specific criteria listed below for DNSH, the text refers only to the relevant criteria specified in Section 7.1. for substantial contribution to climate change mitigation. Where the DNSH criteria under Section 7.7 indicate N/A it means there are no specific requirements for the respective environmental objective. 

### For the activity “Acquisition and ownership of buildings” in Section 7.7., what happens if a building has several Energy Performance Certificates (EPCs)?

When a building has several EPCs, the parts of the buildings covered by EPCs that qualify under the technical screening criteria are to be considered Taxonomy-aligned.

### For the activity “Acquisition and ownership of buildings” in Section 7.7., to determine when a property was ‘built’, which date should be used: i. the date a property was actually completed and delivered to the owner / occupier; ii. the date of the application for a construction permit; or iii. the date of the confirmation of completion of a construction permit?

For the application of the Taxonomy criteria, the date of the application for a construction permit is relevant.

### For buildings built after 31 December 2020, can the construction phase of a newly constructed property be considered as being part of the acquisition process? Can the drawn part of a construction mortgage loan therefore be considered under Section 7.7 (“Acquisition and ownership of buildings”), paragraph 2? Put differently: should Section 7.7 paragraph 2 only be used for buildings that have been completed or also for buildings that are being built? Or alternatively, should the consumer be seen as the entity undertaking the economic activity of Section 7.1 (“Construction of new buildings”) and the realised part of a property be considered for EU Taxonomy alignment according to 7.1 only?

In the case of the construction of a new building, for the construction company (and for its revenues to be considered under the EU Taxonomy), the criteria under Section 7.1. apply. For the owner of the new building (whether it acquires the building through an acquisition, or if it is building its own building), the value of the building can be considered under the EU Taxonomy based on the criteria under Section 7.7. 

### Can companies use Energy Performance Certificate (EPC) equivalents for assessing alignment with the technical screening criteria of the activity “Acquisition and ownership of buildings” in Section 7.7. in countries where EPC is not offered?

In the EU, all Member States have EPCs. However, some Member States may exclude specific types of buildings from EPC schemes e.g. industrial buildings, temporary buildings. Within the EU, whenever an EPC is available for the relevant building considered, it should be used. When this is not possible, equivalents can be used instead. Outside the EU, equivalents can be used instead of the EPCs.

### How are buildings assessed in countries where there is no Nearly Zero Energy Buildings (NZEB) threshold, i.e. countries outside the EU? Can companies use equivalents or thresholds from an EU country with a similar climate?

Some countries, even outside EU, have defined NZEB and low energy buildings. Wherever such definitions exist, they can be used. When NZEB are not clearly defined in the national legislation, equivalents can be used, e.g. equivalents or thresholds from an EU country with a similar climate, when possible.

### Can the construction of a building for own use count towards the activity "Construction of new buildings" in Section 7.1. or “Acquisition and ownership of buildings” in Section 7.7.?

Yes, the construction of a new building for own use can be covered under Section 7.1 “ _Construction of new buildings_ ”, or Section 7.7 “ _Acquisition and ownership of buildings_ ”. 

### Does the Energy Performance Certificate (EPC) class A in the substantial contribution criteria for activities related to the construction and real estate sector refer to primary energy demand or total energy demand?

The Energy Performance Certificate (EPC) ‘class A’ that is required under the substantial contribution criteria of activity in Section 7.7. (“ _Acquisition and Ownership of buildings_ ”) refers to the EPC class of the EPC scheme in the relevant Member State. The numerical indicator expressed in kWh/m2, mentioned in the EPC, is relevant and should be considered. 

### What are the rules for defining the top 15% and top 30% benchmarks of the national market (with a distinction between residential and commercial) as referenced in the technical screening criteria of the activity “Acquisition and ownership of buildings” in Section 7.7.? What should be done if there is no Energy Performance Certificate (EPC) nor any data to determine whether a building belongs to the best 15% of the national building stock?

For determining Taxonomy-alignment, it should be demonstrated that a building is within the top 15% (or 30% for climate change adaptation) of the national or regional building stock, by adequate evidence. There are no specific rules for defining the top 15% or 30% of the building stock, beyond the requirements of referring to the national or regional building stock expressed as operational Primary Energy Demand (PED), and distinguishing at least between residential and non-residential buildings. 

In the absence of a relevant EPC, a technical study can be done to estimate the relevant threshold for the top 15% of the national (or regional) building stock for that category of building. There may be information available from national databases or studies produced by certain organisations (e.g. World Green Building Council). 

Whenever there is such a study publicly available, it can be used. When there is no study available, it has to be conducted. It can be expected that e.g. interested market actors or associations/institutes/public authorities could be willing to conduct or commission such studies and make them public, so that other entities (in particular smaller ones) could use them afterwards.

The EPC remains the simplest option, in the EU, as it can easily be obtained for most buildings, and it is also a mandatory when a building is sold. 

The revision of the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive is considering how to address the availability of information on energy performance as well as databases on energy performance certificates.

### What should be done if it is currently not possible to quantitatively name the top 15 % of the building stock before 31.12.2020, and there is no corresponding national evaluation of the Energy Performance Certificates (EPCs) already issued, and there is no valid data based on the operating energy demand of the existing building stock? As a first simplification, can calculated energy efficiency data (e.g. from energy performance certificates with standardised energy requirements for household electricity / operating electricity) be used as opposed to real consumption data (from buildings in operation) to determine Taxonomy-alignment with the substantial contribution criteria of the activity “Acquisition and ownership of buildings” in Section 7.7.?

In order to use the option of demonstrating that the building is within the top 15% of the national or regional building, adequate evidence should be provided (e.g. a recent study), which at least compares the performance of the relevant asset to the performance of the national or regional stock built before 31 December 2020 and at least distinguishes between residential and non-residential buildings. If such data is not available, a study can be conducted to perform such an assessment. Alternatively, the option of an EPC class A can be used. 

There is no requirement to conduct the assessment based on real consumption data for demonstrating that a building is within the top 15% of the building stock. In fact, it is recommended to use estimated energy consumption, which better reflects the energy performance of the building (being less influenced by occupancy and behaviour patterns). Only for large non-residential buildings (with an effective rated output for heating systems, systems for combined space heating and ventilation, air-conditioning systems or systems for combined air-conditioning and ventilation of over 290 kW), it is required to show that the building is also efficiently operated through energy performance monitoring and assessment.

### Is it permissible to use a weighted requirement value based on the valid new building regulations of the last 15 years for the definition of the necessary requirement value for "the best 15 % of the stock" as referred to in substantial contribution criteria of the activity “Acquisition and ownership of buildings” in Section 7.7.?

The technical screening criteria require “ _adequate evidence, which at least compares the performance of the relevant asset to the performance of the national or regional stock built before 31 December 2020 and at least distinguishes between residential and non-residential buildings”_ if the option of the “ _top 15% of the national or regional building stock”_ is used. It is not possible to use proxies, such as the year of the construction of the building. 

### The top 15% is a dynamic metric. Is grandfathering guaranteed for properties, e.g. over the entire term of a green bond, if they were among the top 15% at the time of issue?

There is no grandfathering of the technical screening criteria themselves. If the criteria are revised and changed, or an activity falls out of compliance with criteria that are dynamic, a new assessment of (and where relevant effort to ensure) compliance is needed, as of the date when the criteria apply. This is distinct from the grandfathering of financial instruments or transactions on the basis of the criteria at the time of issuance or conclusion of a loan, where separate rules apply. (see for instance Article 7(5) of the Disclosures Delegated Act which allows financial undertakings to report financed Taxonomy-aligned activities as such for up to five years after the application of revised criteria/changed coverage of criteria). 

### What is the definition of operational Primary Energy Demand (PED)?

The Annex I to the Delegated Act clarifies in footnote 281 that the Primary Energy Demand is ‘ _the calculated amount of energy needed to meet the energy demand associated with the typical uses of a building expressed by a numeric indicator of total primary energy use in kWh/m 2 per year and based on the relevant national calculation methodology and as displayed on the Energy Performance Certificate (EPC).’_

The Energy Performance of Buildings Directive defines in Article 2(5) primary energy as “ _energy from renewable and non-renewable sources which has not undergone any conversion or transformation process”_. It also explains in Annex I that “ _the energy performance of a building shall be determined on the basis of calculated or actual energy use and shall reflect typical energy use for space heating, space cooling, domestic hot water, ventilation, built-in lighting and other technical building systems”_.

### The non-existing differentiation between residential and non-residential buildings in some Member States leads to the de facto inapplicability of these assessment categories for non-residential buildings, especially in the area of primary energy demand and the calculated CO2 emissions. Due to the higher electricity demand for non-residential buildings, the achievement of an A rating for primary energy demand and CO2 applies to very few buildings (even highly efficient non-residential buildings). What approach should be followed in such a situation?

EU Member States have a certain flexibility in how to define the requirements for various types of buildings. In many cases the requirements are different for residential and non-residential buildings. For the purpose of the EU Taxonomy, the relevant criteria applicable to the relevant type of building should be complied with. In some Member States the criteria are strict and a very small share of buildings would qualify under the EPC class A. In such cases, the option of demonstrating that the building is within the top 15% of the national or regional building stock can be used.

### How should an energy management programme or system look like (e.g. according to ISO 50001 or EMAS)? Who is responsible – the tenant/user of the building or the landlord? What happens if tenants are changing or when the type of use changes within the property? Will there be concrete requirements regarding the documentation?

The requirement is “ _Where the building is a large non-residential building (with an effective rated output for heating systems, systems for combined space heating and ventilation, air-conditioning systems or systems for combined air-conditioning and ventilation of over 290 kW) it is efficiently operated through energy performance monitoring and assessment”_. Commission Recommendation on Building Modernisation provides guidance and interpretation on this.

### What is the procedure if there is no national implementation of the requirements contained in Article 14(4) and Article 15(4) of Energy Performance of Buildings Directive as amended? Until national requirements are established, can an equivalent listing of the measures actually taken be used to determine alignment with the technical screening criteria of the activity “Acquisition and ownership of buildings” in Section 7.7.?

The technical screening criteria require that large non-residential buildings (with an effective rated output for heating systems, systems for combined space heating and ventilation, air-conditioning systems or systems for combined air-conditioning and ventilation of over 290 kW) are efficiently operated through energy performance monitoring and assessment. This can be demonstrated, for example, through the presence of an Energy Performance Contract or a building automation and control system in accordance with Article 14 (4) and Article 15 (4), of Energy Performance of Buildings Directive. Therefore, a certain flexibility is allowed on how to demonstrate that a building is efficiently operated. 

Wherever a national definition for building automation and control systems exists, it can be used. In case such a national definition does not exist, best practices should be used instead, and the elements included in the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive in relation to building automation and control systems can be used as a reference. 

### Are heritage or protected buildings that are exempt from the Energy Performance Certificates (EPC) under national law, also exempt from demonstrating compliance with the EPC or Primary Energy demand requirements specified in Section 7.7 (“Acquisition and ownership of buildings”)?

Section 7.7 does not provide a derogation for buildings with heritage or protected status. Therefore, in order to qualify as making a substantial contribution to climate change mitigation, all buildings that are built before 31 December 2020 must have at least an Energy Performance Certificate of Class A or be within the top 15% of the national or regional buildings stock expressed as operational Primary Energy Demand. 

However, entities have the option to explain in the narrative part of their reporting under Section 1.2.3. of Annex I to the Disclosures Delegated Act why certain assets are not Taxonomy-aligned, e.g. because they are heritage buildings.

### Does Section 7.7 (“Acquisition and ownership of buildings”) differentiate the eligibility of the revenues derived from the ownership of the building (meeting technical screening criteria) depending on the type of economic activity being carried out? For example, in the case of airport buildings and terminals meeting the technical screening criteria under Section 7.7, can the revenues derived from the building ownership be covered regardless of their nature e.g. rents from duty-free shops or rents from ground handlers operations in the terminal?

Activities detailed within the framework of Section 7.7 do not define the type of revenues derived from the building ownership that can be eligible or not. However, only revenues derived from the ownership of the building, e.g. rents, can be considered regardless of the activities that take place in a building (duty free shops, ground handlers operations). Other non-related revenues, e.g. revenues that are not derived from the ownership of the building, but directly from aeronautical activities carried out by the airport operator cannot be considered and are not covered by this activity. For instance, the rents for the occupation of the building paid by duty free-shops are eligible, but not the revenues generated by duty free shops from the sale of products to consumers.

### Are electronic communications networks (telecommunication) covered under the activities “Data processing, hosting and related activities” in Section 8.1. or “Data-driven solutions for GHG emissions reductions” in Section 8.2 ?

Electronic communications networks (telecommunication) as such are not included as an activity under the current coverage of the Taxonomy delegated act. 

Section 8.2 of Annex I to the Climate Delegated Act targets specific digital solutions that are developed with the predominant (main) purpose to reduce emissions. Such solutions can be an innovative combination of digital networks and technologies and applications such as 5G, Internet of Things, Artificial Intelligence (AI), and blockchain.

An example of such a solution can be a precision farming solution, solutions for improving the energy efficiency of buildings or AI based solutions that reduce the energy consumption of 5G base stations. Consequently, solutions that significantly reduce emissions of the electronic communications services compared to best available alternative technologies are eligible under Section 8.2 of Annex I to the Climate Delegated Act.

While the generic public electronic communications network is an important and necessary infrastructure for the ICT solutions mentioned above, its predominant use or deployment is often not to reduce emissions. In cases where the electronic communications network is deployed and used in the context of the solution for GHG emissions reductions (for example, a specific machine-to-machine communication infrastructure to be used for precision farming) it is eligible under Section 8.2. Additions to a public electronic communication infrastructure required in the context of supporting the connectivity needs of the solution for GHG emissions reductions (such as network enhancement or support of network features required for the solution) are also eligible under Section 8.2.

### For the activity “Data processing, hosting and related activities” in Section 8.1., how can compliance with the European Code of Conduct on Data Centre Energy Efficiency be audited?

The substantial contribution criteria for climate change mitigation require an independent verification and regular audit (at least every three years) of the implementation of all relevant expected practices laid down in the European Code of Conduct on Data Centre Energy Efficiency. 

The Code of Conduct will shortly (late 2022/ early 2023) be complemented with an assessment framework to assist auditors in verifying a data centre’s compliance with the relevant expected practices set out in the Code of Conduct on Data Centre Energy Efficiency.

### For the activity “Data processing, hosting and related activities” in Section 8.1., who carries the burden of proof to demonstrate Taxonomy-alignment in the case of colocation data centres?

The burden of proof lies with the economic undertakings that are required to disclose their share of Taxonomy-aligned activities under the Disclosures Delegated Act or wish to have their economic activities classified as environmentally sustainable under the Taxonomy Regulation.

In the case of colocation data centres, the demonstration of compliance with the European Code of Conduct on Data Centre Energy Efficiency might require close cooperation and the exchange of technical data between hosts and tenants.

### Does the ICT solution referred to in the technical screening criteria of the activity “Data-driven solutions for GHG emissions reduction” in Section 8.2. need to be predominantly aimed at the provision of data and analytics and greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reductions have to be a necessary side effect or does the ICT solution need to be predominantly aimed at reducing GHG emissions using data and analytics?

The ICT solution could be substantially contributing in either case, provided that, where an alternative solution/technology is already available on the market, the ICT solution demonstrates substantial life-cycle GHG emission savings compared to the best performing alternative solution/technology. 

### How is ‘substantial’ defined in point 2 of the substantial contribution criteria of the activity “Data-driven solutions for GHG emissions reduction” in Section 8.2., which refer to ‘substantial life-cycle GHG emission savings’? How is ‘best performing alternative’ defined?

Please refer to the replies to questions 42-43 of this Notice regarding the activity “Manufacture of other low carbon technologies”. 

### Should expenses relating to research and development (R&D) be considered as part of the activity they relate to or as a separate activity under Section 9.1. (“Close to market research, development and innovation”)?

Both scenarios are possible. 

When R&D is an integral part of the activity that is covered in the Climate Delegated Act (in-house R&D that is integrated in the activity), it can be counted under that activity and the associated expenditures disclosed accordingly. 

In other cases, where research is not integrated in a Taxonomy activity, but helps other Taxonomy activities reach their substantial contribution thresholds, it can be counted as a separate enabling activity under Section 9.1 and, where relevant, disclosed as a revenue-generating activity.

### What is the difference between the technical screening criteria for substantial contribution to climate change adaptation set out in Annex II and the technical screening criteria for DNSH to climate change adaptation set out in Annex I (climate change mitigation)?

The DNSH criteria for climate change adaptation, which are included in Annex I to the Climate Delegated Act, cover a part of the substantial contribution criteria for climate change adaptation, i.e. a risk and vulnerability assessment must be carried out to identify adaptation solutions.

However, the substantial contribution criteria for climate change adaptation as included in Annex II to the Climate Delegated Act, add the requirement to _implement_ the identified adaptation solutions. The criteria for their implementation are specified in point 4 of the substantial contribution criteria. Thus, as regards to the implementation of adaptation solutions that substantially reduce the most important physical climate risks, material to the activity under scrutiny, the substantial contribution criteria for adaptation (included in Annex II to the Climate Delegated Act) reflect a higher level of ambition than those for DNSH in [Appendix A](./assets/documents/None Appendix A.pdf) in Annex I to the Climate Delegated Act.

Some economic activities cover only part of the value chain and have no impact on the part of the value chain that is predominantly threatened by climate change. How should this be addressed in the climate risk and vulnerability assessment?

It should be assured beyond reasonable doubt that the economic activity that is being targeted, cannot be affected by secondary or cascading impacts since major damage can often occur as a result of a succession of events (e.g. landslide after heavy rains). This can be done upfront or on the basis of the climate risk and vulnerability assessment. 

The depth of the assessment may also vary, as long as it is sufficient to identify the physical climate risks that are material to the activity. For example, the extent to which risks may exist in the supply chain or in upstream production processes and whether these aspects need to be considered in the assessment can be weighed up individually for each activity. Decisive factors for the proportionality of the selected assessment approach can be the size of the company, the type, scale and context of the activity, the business model or the position in the supply chain.

The climate risk and vulnerability assessment needs to divide the economic activity (to the extent possible) into separate individual objects such as production sites, transport lines, adjacent administrative buildings, suppliers of critical material, their geographic location, etc. 

The basis for a robust climate risk assessment is an understanding of how hazards can affect each individual object with regard to the activity under assessment. Some impacts of hazards are obvious, such as direct damage to production sites from flooding or storm events. However, not all climate impacts occur in a direct manner, but rather in succession with the potential of secondary impacts in a chain (so-called cascading effects). For example, storm events can damage the site of a critical supplier or energy infrastructure and cause power outages. Furthermore, risks can reinforce each other. Some risks even arise only through the combined effect of several climate hazards: some risks are exacerbated by successive hazards; for example, the risk of flooding is intensified when heavy rainfall hits dried-out soils.

### With the submission of the 6th IPCC Assessment Report, the IPCC presented new climate scenarios. Are these to be taken into account instead of the existing scenarios cited in the EU Taxonomy?

Criterion 3 of the substantial contribution criteria to climate change adaptation specifies that _“climate projections and assessment of impacts are based on best practice and available guidance and take into account the state-of-the-art science for vulnerability and risk analysis and related methodologies in line with the most recent Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change reports”_. 

Therefore, users should refer to the most recent IPCC Assessment Reports once they become available. 

### By when should an implementation in regional, high-resolution climate scenarios be aimed for? How will conformity with the requirements of the EU Taxonomy be ensured in this case?

Progress is being made in the asset-level modelling through the European Horizon Europe research programme and in the development of specific regional high-resolution projections. In all likelihood, the higher the demand for the high-resolution climate scenarios, the faster the supply will adjust. For the Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) scenarios RCP2,6, RCP4.5 and RCP8.5, regional climate models with approx. 12.5*12.5 km² resolution are available on the European level. For some countries, there are further regionalized data with 5*5 km² resolution.

### Is it required to use all 4 IPCC pathways (RCP 2.6, RCP 4.5, RCP 6.0 and RCP 8.5)? Do the outcomes of each analysis have to be assessed separately?

No, it is not required to use all 4 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) pathways. 

To start the assessment, it is important to see whether the activity that is subject to the climate risk and vulnerability assessment has been subject to impacts from some hazards in the past (e.g. sea-level rise). If this is not the case, following line with the precautionary principle, RCP 8.5 (i.e. low mitigation) should be always used. If positive, lower end scenarios, e.g. RCP 4.5 could be used. 

The outcomes of each analysis should be assessed separately. 

### How should a company proceed if not all of the four main scenarios of the IPCC are available?

In principle, the available IPCC models should be used at a scale that is meaningful and proportionate for assessing potential impacts from hazards within the timeframe of the economic activity (above 10 years).

The undertaking should make sure it has access to the climate data relevant for the climate risk assessment. This data is normally available on CORDEX. Regionalised climate data with the highest possible resolution should be requested from the national meteorological services. The European Environment Agency (EEA) provides an interactive report with climate data (based on CMIP5 and EURO-CORDEX) aggregated at the level of subnational administrative regions and already assigned to climate hazards. In addition, climate data for individual scenarios can be retrieved from the European Climate Data Explorer. 

Regarding the choice of adequate Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) to be taken into consideration, according to the [Technical guidance on the climate proofing of infrastructure in the period 2021-2027](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=OJ:C:2021:373:TOC)(60)Commission Notice — Technical guidance on the climate proofing of infrastructure in the period 2021-2027 (OJ JOC_2021_373_R_000)., RCP 4.5 may be used for climate projections up to 2060 as until that year there are only small differences between the scenarios. However, for subsequent years, RCP 4.5 may begin to underestimate the changes, in particular, if GHG emissions prove higher than anticipated. Hence, it could be more relevant to use RCP 6.0 and RCP 8.5 for current projections until 2100. Warming under RCP 8.5 is widely considered to be greater than current business-as-usual scenarios, but it has relevance from the perspective of risk management since tipping points could not be fully accounted for in IPCC projections, while climate change impacts have already been more pronounced than expected.

### How does proportionality influence the scope of the robust climate risk and vulnerability assessment that has to be conducted as part of the DNSH climate change adaptation criteria?

The objective of the robust climate risk and vulnerability assessment is to identify significant physical climate risks to the performance of the economic activity. This assessment then forms the basis for the identification of suitable adaptation measures that are presented as part of an adaptation plan. 

According to the Climate Delegated Act, Annex 1, [Appendix A](./assets/documents/None Appendix A.pdf), the climate risk and vulnerability assessment carried out should follow state-of-the-art methodology and take into account the most recent highest-resolution data available. The scope of the assessment, methods and data used to achieve this objective may vary to maintain proportionality. For example, in many cases it may be enough to use a pessimistic scenario, such as RCP 8.5, and not consider all four RCP scenarios, provided that the consideration of additional scenarios is unlikely to yield new insights relevant for the risk assessment. 

The depth of the assessment may also vary, as long as it is sufficient to identify the physical climate risks that are material to the activity. For example, the extent to which risks may exist in the supply chain or in upstream production processes and whether these aspects need to be considered in the assessment can be weighed up individually for each activity. Decisive factors for the proportionality of the selected assessment approach can be the size of the company, the type, scale and context of the activity, the business model or the position in the supply chain. For example, replacing windows in an office building to improve energy efficiency requires a less detailed climate risk assessment than building a dam to generate hydropower. 

The frequency of the climate risk and vulnerability assessment should also be proportionate to its objectives. Appropriate occasions for updates of the assessment and the resulting adaptation plan are changes that increase the exposure to the identified risks or that may pose new risks or significantly alter already identified risks to the performance of the economic activity, such as changes in:

  *     * the assessed economic activity, e.g. new suppliers or new production facilities;
    * the climate data basis of the assessment, e.g. unforeseen changes in climatic systems, changes in assumptions for climate models, or technological advances in climate modelling. 



### What documentation must be provided to meet DNSH requirements related to climate change adaptation?

To meet the requirements for DNSH to climate change adaptation for an economic activity for the purpose of the EU Taxonomy, it is essential to present a coherent adaptation plan if climate risks have been identified. The measures included in the plan should have been systematically assessed for their suitability to reduce the most important physical climate risks for the activity while meeting additional requirements outlined in the Climate Delegated Act. The adaptation plan should also include a timetable for implementing the measures and a documentation of measures already implemented. Adaptation measures have to be implemented for new assets at the time of completion and for existing assets within five years of the identification of the associated climate risks. 

The most important physical climate risks have to be identified using a robust, comprehensible and proportionate climate risk and vulnerability assessment.

### Will the use of existing environmental risk inventories (e.g. for floods, avalanches) with consideration of particularly relevant environmental risk scenarios (e.g. for temperature, precipitation, wind) suffice for the time being?

The existing environmental risk inventories that include the most important and relevant climate parameters are sufficient for the time being. 

### What are the minimum requirements for a climate risk and vulnerability assessment in terms of scope and level of details (materiality of risks etc.)?

Lifespan

All relevant objects of the economic activity should be considered 

A range of climate projections based on future scenarios 

Catalogue of climate-related “hazards that are to be taken into account as a minimum" (Climate Delegated Act, Annex I, [Appendix A](./assets/documents/None Appendix A.pdf)) 

### Which standards need to be used to conduct a climate risk and vulnerability analysis (ISO, EU guidelines on climate resilience for infrastructure projects)? Are undertakings free to choose their own method?

There is no single method of developing the climate risk and vulnerability assessment. They can be based on a wide range of approaches to gather information, from data and model driven approaches (e.g., climate data, impact models) to more review, or expert-based approaches. However, an ISO-norm ([ISO/DIS 14091: Adaptation to climate change — Guidelines on vulnerability, impacts and risk assessment](https://www.iso.org/standard/68508.html))(61)The norm is a part of a family of ISO 14090 standards which address climate change adaptation in the stage of pre-planning, assessing impacts including opportunities, adaptation planning, implementation, monitoring and evaluation, and reporting and communication. ISO 14091 elaborates on assessing impacts including opportunities. transposed also as European standard and national standards in Member States, contains a selection of useful tools, covering the entire process of preparing, conducting, and communicating the results of the assessment. More specifically, these tools provide guidance on, e.g. developing impact chains, aggregating indicators and risk components, or assessing adaptive capacity. Recently, there is also a grant under preparation(62)Call HORIZON-MISS-2021-CLIMA-02-01: Development of climate change risk assessments in European regions based on a transparent and harmonised Climate Risk Assessment approach. with “ _an operational, consistent and more advanced multi-risk assessment framework tool across scales and levels of governance that can be used by all regions and communities in Europe”_ among the expected outcomes.

### What is meant by ‘state-of-the-art climate projections’ referred to in the substantial contribution criteria to climate change adaptation?

Latest projections taking into account the evolving scientific knowledge (e.g. on tipping points).

### How are the criteria in points (d), (e) and (f) of Appendix C to be applied?

The generic DNSH criteria to pollution prevention and control regarding use and presence of chemicals as set out in [Appendix C](./assets/documents/None Appendix C.pdf) of Annex I to the Delegated Act specify that an activity does not cause significant harm to pollution prevention and control if the activity does not lead to the manufacture, placing on the market or use of two groups of substances (whether on their own, in mixtures or in an article). 

These include (under points (f) and (g)): 

  * Substances meeting the criteria set out in Article 57 of  REACH and identified in accordance with Article 59 (1) of that Regulation (i.e. substances identified as of very high concern and placed on the ‘candidate list’ under REACH), except where their use has been proven to be essential for the society; 



 

  * Other substances meeting the criteria set out in Article 57 of REACH (i.e. substances meeting the criteria for substance of very high concern), except where their use has been proven to be essential for the society. 



In order to apply the concept of an “ _essential use for the society”_ , it is necessary to determine whether the concept is applicable, i.e. whether the economic activity leads to the manufacture, placing on the market or use of those substance identified in points (f) or (g), (i.e. substances identified as substance of very high concern and substances meeting the criteria for substances of very high concern). This information should be obtained through the supply chain. 

In line with the commitment in the Chemicals Strategy for Sustainability, the Commission is preparing a horizontal document to define criteria for essential use to ensure that the most harmful chemicals are only allowed if their use is necessary for health, safety or is critical for the functioning of society and if there are no alternatives that are acceptable from the standpoint of environment and health. The aim is to define the criteria coherently across the EU legislation and to explain how to assess whether uses of chemicals are essential for society. In this work, criteria for essential use in the Montreal Protocol are taken into account, while adapting them to be workable for the whole EU chemicals acquis. The Commission aims to finalise this work in early 2023.

Compliance with point (d) of [Appendix C](./assets/documents/None Appendix C.pdf) only applies within the scope of the Directive 2011/65/EU (RoHS Directive). The scope of the RoHS Directive is set in Article 2 of this Directive, e.g. ~~,~~ large-scale fixed installations or means of transport for persons or goods, excluding electric two-wheel vehicles which are not type-approved, are excluded. 

### Does the same restriction on building elements and materials, as for activities in Sections 7.1 (“Construction of new buildings”) and 7.2 (“Renovation of existing buildings”) for formaldehyde and other carcinogenic volatile organic compounds of categories 1A and 1B (" ... with which occupants come into contact ...") apply to the demonstration of compliance?

To demonstrate compliance with the requirements of the DNSH criteria for pollution prevention and control as set out in Sections 7.1 and 7.2, building components and materials used in construction that may come into contact with occupiers should fulfil two conditions: 

  * These building components and materials do not contain substances identified in [Appendix C](./assets/documents/None Appendix C.pdf). This is a general condition and it can be achieved by asking suppliers for information about the presence of a substance in manufacture, materials and articles. If the substance specified in points (f) and (g) of [Appendix C](./assets/documents/None Appendix C.pdf) is present, proof is provided to justify that their use is essential for the society. 
  * When using formaldehyde, formaldehyde releasing substances or volatile organic carcinogens – and these uses are essential for society – the use of these substances should comply with the emission limits set in the second paragraph of the DNSH criteria for Pollution prevention and control. Compliance with such emission limits has to be verified by testing. 



### In particular with regard to REACH and CLP compliance, is there a specific, reduced listing of pollutants to be avoided, to be reduced for construction products and building components or are the above-mentioned regulations to be applied in their full length for construction products and building components? If yes, which EU-wide available data / product inventory with regard to product conformity can be used for this purpose?

All conditions set out in [Appendix C](./assets/documents/None Appendix C.pdf), i.e. points (a) to (g), apply whenever a reference is made to the [Appendix C](./assets/documents/None Appendix C.pdf) in the DNSH criteria for pollution prevention and control. 

 

No simplified list of substances is available for construction products and building components. Nevertheless, the substances covered in points (a) to (e) of the DNSH criteria are listed in the relevant Articles and/or Annexes of the respective regulations referenced.  

The list of substances covered in point (f) are available by consulting the candidate list of substances of very high concern managed by the European Chemicals Agency pursuant to Article 59(10) of the REACH Regulation. The candidate list is available on-line on the following link: [Candidate List of substances of very high concern for Authorisation - ECHA (europa.eu)](https://echa.europa.eu/candidate-list-table)  

Substances covered by point (g) can be found in several sources, depending on the particular paragraph of REACH Art 57 they belong to:

As regards REACH Art. 57(a-c): one source is the classification and labelling inventory managed by the European Chemical Agency pursuant to Article 42 of the CLP Regulation. The inventory provides information on the hazard classifications of substances, which can be compared with the criteria laid down in Article 57 (a)-(c) of REACH. The inventory lists substances with harmonised classifications (assessed and concluded by authorities) as well as self-classifications (assessed and concluded by industry itself). The classification and labelling inventory is available on-line at: C&L Inventory – ECHA on europa.eu

As regards REACH Art. 57(d-f): The hazard categories mentioned in this paragraph are not yet covered by the C&L Inventory. ECHA manages lists of substances under assessment by its informal ECHA Expert Groups. The lists provide an indication of substances that might meet the criteria laid down in Article 57 (d)-(f) of REACH as well as substances that likely do not meet the criteria or substances under assessment. The persistency, bioaccumulation and toxicity (PBT) assessment list provides information on those properties of substances, which can be compared with the criteria laid down in Article 57 (d)-(e) of REACH. The inventory is available on-line at: <https://echa.europa.eu/pbt>. 

The endocrine disruptor (ED) assessment list provides information on those properties of substances, which can be compared with the criteria laid down in Article 57 (f) of REACH. The inventory is available on-line at: https://echa.europa.eu/ed-assessment. 

In line with the Chemicals Strategy for Sustainability commitment, the Commission is preparing inclusion of new hazard classes (including PBTs, vPvBs and EDs) in the CLP Regulation (EC) No 1272/2008. If and when the hazard classes are included in the CLP Regulation, the C&L Inventory will gradually include information on the hazard classifications of substances covered by the point (g) in [Appendix C](./assets/documents/None Appendix C.pdf). 

### Point (g) in Appendix C seems similar to point (f). Is this meant to broaden the scope to other substances not currently under consideration and if so, how should it apply?

The criterion in point (g) aims to broaden the list of possible substances subject to [Appendix C](./assets/documents/None Appendix C.pdf). This criterion aims to identify substances – whether on their own, in mixtures or in an article – that meet the criteria set out in Article 57 of REACH but that are not yet included in a candidate list for potential inclusion in Annex XIV to that Regulation. 

Whenever a substance meets the criteria of Article 57 of REACH but has not yet been placed on the candidate list for eventual inclusion in Annex XIV, this substance is subject to the criterion in point (g). 

Substances covered by point (g) can be found in several sources, depending on the particular paragraph of REACH Art 57 they belong to:

As regards REACH Art. 57(a-c): one source is the classification and labelling inventory managed by the European Chemical Agency pursuant to Article 42 of the CLP Regulation. The inventory provides information on the hazard classifications of substances, which can be compared with the criteria laid down in Article 57 (a)-(c) of REACH. The inventory lists substances with harmonised classifications (assessed and concluded by authorities) as well as self-classifications (assessed and concluded by industry itself). The classification and labelling inventory is available on-line at: C&L Inventory – ECHA on europa.eu

As regards REACH Art. 57(d-f): The hazard categories mentioned in this paragraph are not yet covered by the C&L Inventory. ECHA manages lists of substances under assessment by its informal ECHA Expert Groups. The lists provide an indication of substances that might meet the criteria laid down in Article 57 (d)-(f) of REACH as well as substances that likely do not meet the criteria or substances under assessment. The persistency, bioaccumulation and toxicity (PBT) assessment list provides information on those properties of substances, which can be compared with the criteria laid down in Article 57 (d)-(e) of REACH. The inventory is available on-line at: <https://echa.europa.eu/pbt>. 

The endocrine disruptor (ED) assessment list provides information on those properties of substances, which can be compared with the criteria laid down in Article 57 (f) of REACH. The inventory is available on-line at: <https://echa.europa.eu/ed-assessment>. 

In line with the Chemicals Strategy for Sustainability commitment, the Commission is preparing inclusion of new hazard classes (including PBTs, vPvBs and EDs) in the CLP Regulation (EC) No 1272/2008. If and when the hazard classes are included in the CLP Regulation, the C&L Inventory will gradually include information on the hazard classifications of substances covered by the point (g) in [Appendix C](./assets/documents/None Appendix C.pdf). 

### Do the generic do no significant harm criteria in Appendix C cover the manufacturing process? How shall undertakings deal with the list of substances in Appendix C point (g) regarding compliance of an alignment assessment?

Yes, the manufacturing process is subject to the criteria set out in [Appendix C](./assets/documents/None Appendix C.pdf). 

Substances covered by point (g) can be found in several sources, depending on the particular paragraph of REACH Art 57 they belong to:

As regards REACH Art. 57(a-c): one source is the classification and labelling inventory managed by the European Chemical Agency pursuant to Article 42 of the CLP Regulation. The inventory provides information on the hazard classifications of substances, which can be compared with the criteria laid down in Article 57 (a)-(c) of REACH. The inventory lists substances with harmonised classifications (assessed and concluded by authorities) as well as self-classifications (assessed and concluded by industry itself). The classification and labelling inventory is available on-line at: C&L Inventory – ECHA on europa.eu

As regards REACH Art. 57(d-f): The hazard categories mentioned in this paragraph are not yet covered by the C&L Inventory. ECHA manages lists of substances under assessment by its informal ECHA Expert Groups. The lists provide an indication of substances that might meet the criteria laid down in Article 57 (d)-(f) of REACH as well as substances that likely do not meet the criteria or substances under assessment. The persistency, bioaccumulation and toxicity (PBT) assessment list provides information on those properties of substances, which can be compared with the criteria laid down in Article 57 (d)-(e) of REACH. The inventory is available on-line at: <https://echa.europa.eu/pbt>. 

The endocrine disruptor (ED) assessment list provides information on those properties of substances, which can be compared with the criteria laid down in Article 57 (f) of REACH. The inventory is available on-line at: <https://echa.europa.eu/ed-assessment>.

If and when the hazard classes are included in the CLP Regulation, the C&L Inventory will gradually include information on the hazard classifications of substances covered by the point (g) in [Appendix C](./assets/documents/None Appendix C.pdf). 

### What is the scope of the required analysis for the “use” of the listed substances?

The generic DNSH criteria to pollution prevention and control regarding the use and presence of chemicals set out in [Appendix C](./assets/documents/None Appendix C.pdf) of Annex I to the Delegated Act specify that an activity does not cause significant harm to pollution prevention and control if the activity does not lead to the manufacture, placing on the market or use of certain substances (whether on their own, in mixtures or in an article). 

The information on the manufacture, placing on the market or use of substances should be obtained through the supply chain by request to a direct supplier. 

Proof of compliance that the manufacture, placing on the market or use of substances is in accordance with [Appendix C](./assets/documents/None Appendix C.pdf) can be achieved by requesting this information from the suppliers. 

### Environmental impact assessments (EIAs) are not always required by national law. If the EIA is not required by EU law, is waiving the EIA then harmless for the assessment of Taxonomy-alignment?

Not all activities are subject to a mandatory EIA in accordance with EU law. Nevertheless, for an economic activity to align with a DNSH criteria that requires compliance with [Appendix D](./assets/documents/None Appendix D.pdf), the activity has to fulfil both of the following conditions:

  *     * An Environmental Impact Assessment or screening has been completed and the required mitigation and compensation measures implemented and;
    * An appropriate assessment within the meaning of Art. 6(3) of the Habitat Directive 92/43/EEC has been conducted, where applicable, for sites/operations located in or near biodiversity sensitive areas, and the mitigation measures implemented.



Therefore, there is no need for an EIA in every case. The requirement in the criteria is to go through the process to determine whether there is need for an EIA – “ _An Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) or screening has been completed in accordance with Directive 2011/92/EU_ ”. If the screening has been done and the conclusion is that no EIA is needed, this part of the requirement is met.

As regards the approach outside of the EU, this is spelled out in footnote 334 of [Appendix D](./assets/documents/None Appendix D.pdf): “ _For activities in third countries, in accordance with equivalent applicable national law or international standards requiring the completion of an EIA or screening, for example, IFC Performance Standard 1: Assessment and Management of Environmental and Social Risks.”_

###  What are the minimum requirements of the Environmental Impact Assessment to achieve Taxonomy-alignment?

The formal procedure to undertake an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) is laid out by Directive 2011/92/EC. In practice, the EIA procedure can be summarised as follows:

  *     * The developer of a project may request the competent authority to declare what should be included in the EIA report to be provided (scoping stage);
    * The developer must provide the EIA report including information, in accordance with Art. 5(1) and Annex IV of the Directive;
    * The environmental authorities, local and regional authorities and the public (as well as affected Member states) must be informed and consulted;
    * The competent authority decides whether or not to authorize the project, taking into consideration the results of consultation;
    * The public is informed of the decision and can challenge the decision before the appropriate courts.



### What does “for sites/operations located in or near biodiversity-sensitive areas” mean in practice?

This applies either to activities that would take place within such areas, or activities that are likely to have a significant impact on such areas (hence the “ _or near_ ”). It was not considered feasible to define a kilometre radius for “ _or near_ ”, as this will vary from site to site (e.g. a dam on a river many kilometres downstream could affect the migration of protected fish species such as salmon in a Natura 2000 area upstream). In other words, where there is a likelihood of a significant risk to such area or site (i.e. that would hamper the conservation objectives for the site) from a development within or outside the site, this needs to be assessed by way of an appropriate assessment, prior to any development consent. In the EU, this is in line with EU Bird and Habitats Directives 2009/147/EC and 92/43/EEC. The approach for countries outside of the EU is spelled out in footnote 335 of [Appendix D](./assets/documents/None Appendix D.pdf). 

### Some DNSH criteria seem to be company strategies or plans, rather than activity specific criteria. Is it enough to comply on company level or does it need to be broken down per activity or product level?

Yes, compliance at company level is sufficient in those cases where information at the level of the undertaking is sufficient to determine whether alignment is achieved at the activity-level.

### The Taxonomy criteria referring to the appropriate assessment according with Directive 2009/147/EC and Directive 92/43/EEC for UNESCO World Heritage sites and Key Biodiversity Areas, as well as other protected areas, are complex to implement in absence of the conservation objectives. How can an appropriate assessment be undertaken in the sites and protected areas mentioned in absence of conservation objectives?

Site-specific Conservation objectives are required for sites designated under the Habitats Directive (as soon as designated as “Special Area of Conservation” - SAC) and the Birds Directive (“Special Protection Area” - SPA).(63)See: <https://ec.europa.eu/environment/nature/natura2000/management/docs/commission_note/commission_note2_EN.pdf>

Any appropriate assessment under Article 6.3 of the Habitats Directive should be carried out in light of those objectives.(64)See: <https://ec.europa.eu/environment/nature/natura2000/management/pdf/methodological-guidance_2021-10/EN.pdf>

In the case of a project requiring an appropriate assessment because it is likely to have a significant impact on a site (SAC or SPA) for which there are no conservation objectives yet (whereas the 6-year deadline for the designation as SAC has passed), the setting of conservation objectives should be a precondition, before the appropriate assessment. A project requiring such an assessment would not be compliant with the DNSH criteria for biodiversity if there would not be site-specific conservation objectives for the concerned site.

### Could the application of Article 6(4) of the Habitats Directive (Directive 92/43/EEC) with regard to the application of compensation measures be clarified? If compensation measures are defined, can a project be considered sustainable according to the criteria of the Climate Delegated Act?

In Natura 2000 sites, compensation measures are required for projects that will adversely affect the integrity of a site (Article 6(4) of the Habitats Directive). Such projects do not fulfil the criteria for DNSH to biodiversity and are therefore not Taxonomy-aligned.

### What is the rationale for the Taxonomy Complementary Climate Delegated Act?

The goal of the EU Taxonomy is to prevent greenwashing and to help investors identify economic activities in line with our environmental and climate objectives. ** ** Shifting towards renewable energy is essential for achieving climate neutrality. But it is also necessary to have stable sources to accelerate the transition towards net-zero greenhouse gas emissions.

The [Taxonomy Regulation](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=celex:32020R0852) lays out three types of activities: low-carbon (Article 10(1)), transitional (Article 10(2)) and enabling (Article 16).

In this Complementary Climate Delegated Act, the Commission includes certain nuclear and gas activities in the second category of activities, i.e. transitional, those covered by Article 10(2) of the Taxonomy Regulation. These are activities that cannot yet be replaced by technologically and economically feasible low-carbon alternatives, but do contribute to climate change mitigation and with the potential to play a major role in the transition to a climate-neutral economy, in line with EU climate goals and commitments, and subject to strict conditions, without crowding out investment in renewables.

Furthermore, this Delegated Act also provides for specific disclosure requirements associated with natural gas and nuclear energy activities included in the act, by amending the Delegated Act on disclosures under Article 8 of the Taxonomy Regulation. This amendment will introduce requirements for large listed non-financial and financial companies to disclose the proportion of their activities linked to natural gas and nuclear energy. This should help investors to distinguish between the different activities they are investing in.

### How ambitious are the technical screening criteria, and do the included activities really lead to environmental benefits, e.g. as compared to energy production from coal?

The Taxonomy Complementary Climate Delegated Act includes strict requirements for the activities to qualify. In the case of fossil gas-related activities, for example, the facility should switch fully to renewable or low-carbon gases by 31 December 2035. This can help accelerate the transition from high-emitting energy sources, such as coal, to renewable or low-carbon gases.

Nuclear power is low-carbon. Expert advice sought by the Commission as part of its preparatory work (the reports of the Technical Expert Group until 2020, and the report of the Joint Research Committee in 2021) confirms this.

Following scientific advice, the Commission has concluded that nuclear energy, subject to strict safety and environmental conditions (including on waste disposal) that ensure the respect of the do no significant harm principle, can play a role in the transition towards climate neutrality in line with the European Green Deal.

### What is the rationale for defining nuclear activities as being in line with the EU's climate and environmental objectives?

The Technical Expert Group on Sustainable Finance, advising the Commission on Taxonomy, acknowledged that nuclear represents a low-carbon energy source. This is in line with the positions of international organisations such as the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and the UN Economic Commission for Europe, which consider CO2 emissions from nuclear power plants over their life-cycle comparable to those from renewable energy sources (as low or even lower).

However, expert opinion has been less conclusive on the other environmental impacts of nuclear power and its compatibility with the “do no significant harm (DNSH)” criterion. For this reason, the Commission set up a specific process on nuclear energy, involving a technical assessment by the Joint Research Centre (JRC), the European Commission's science and knowledge service. Their report was published and reviewed by Member States' experts on radiation protection and waste management appointed by the Scientific and Technical Committee under Article 31 of the Euratom Treaty, as well as by experts from the Scientific Committee on Health, Environmental and Emerging Risks (SCHEER). Overall, the report and reviews conclude that compliance with the safety standards and waste management requirements under the regulatory framework in EU Member States ensures a high level of protection for the environment and for people.

For nuclear energy activities to be enlisted under the taxonomy, the screening criteria set requirements beyond the existing regulatory framework; for instance sunset dates for accelerating transition to advanced technologies, and definite dates for operational disposal facilities to be in place.

### What about considerations on nuclear waste?

The [Taxonomy Regulation](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=celex:32020R0852) requires that the long-term disposal of waste does not cause significant or long-term harm to the environment.

Nuclear energy generates a relatively low amount of waste in comparison to the large amount of generated heat and/or electricity. It produces mainly low-level radioactive waste, for which there are disposal facilities that have operated for decades, while high-level radioactive waste accounts for 1% of total nuclear waste.

The EU regulatory framework establishes the legal requirement for national policies to keep the generation of radioactive waste to a minimum.

In addition, the technical screening criteria for nuclear energy go beyond requiring mere compliance with legislation regarding radioactive waste management and disposal.  Notably, disposal facilities for low-level waste must be operational already, and Member States should have in place a detailed plan to have in operation, by 2050, a disposal facility for high-level radioactive waste. Some Member States have more advanced projects regarding the long-term disposal of nuclear waste. The inclusion of nuclear energy in the EU Taxonomy can accelerate the development of solutions for final waste disposal elsewhere in the EU. In addition, the technical screening criteria for nuclear energy prohibit the export of radioactive waste for disposal in third countries.

### What is the rationale for defining certain gas-related activities as “substantially contributing to” the EU climate and environmental objectives?

During the public consultation conducted in November 2020 for the preparation of the Climate Delegated Act, the energy sector attracted the largest number of responses. Stakeholders notably commented on bioenergy, hydropower, geothermal plants, hydrogen and natural gas. Many stakeholders suggested that natural gas should be recognised for its role as a transition fuel in decarbonisation and that criteria for transitional activities should take into account different starting points across Member States and be attainable with existing technologies. The first EU Taxonomy Climate Delegated Act did not include any transitional activities in the energy sector. However, the European Commission committed to adopting a complementary Delegated Act capturing activities relevant for the climate objectives, but not yet reflected in the first Climate Delegated Act.

The European Union has translated the goal of the Paris Agreement into a long-term European growth strategy. Under the European Green Deal, the EU is working on implementing a comprehensive set of legislative proposals (most recently, [the Fit for 55 Package](https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/IP_21_3541)). The European Commission tabled its proposals based on robust evidence: the Fit for 55 Package rests on a common analytical base with energy system modelling at its core. According to the scenarios in this modelling, natural gas will continue to play an important role in terms of consumption and generation until 2030, after which we expect a decline to 2050. Throughout the transition of our energy system, the function of natural gas-fired electricity generation will change and will increasingly be a facilitator for the spread of renewable electricity and stable supply.

The EU Taxonomy complements these policies and plays a role in transitioning the financial sector to a more sustainable model. The Complementary Delegated Act has been prepared using the same coherent analytical base as the one of the [Climate Target Plan](https://ec.europa.eu/clima/eu-action/european-green-deal/2030-climate-target-plan_en) and the Fit for 55 Package. The Commission's proposal is therefore consistent with the Commission's modelling underpinning its most ambitious legislative package for our climate. The Complementary Delegated Act recognises the specific role of natural gas-related activities in the transition. The carefully crafted set of technical screening criteria ensure that all relevant requirements of the Taxonomy Regulation are complied with. By identifying the role of natural gas in the transition, the Delegated Act also recognises the different situations in our Member States, while contributing to a sustainable transition.

### Unlike nuclear power, natural gas undoubtedly releases CO2 when it is converted into electricity or heat. How can this form of energy lead to environmental benefits?

The Taxonomy Regulation sets out that substantial contribution to climate change mitigation can be achieved through, among other things, the avoidance or reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. Article 10(2) complements this by phasing out greenhouse gas emissions, in particular emissions from solid fossil fuels – a requirement that has been taken into account in the technical screening criteria in the Complementary Delegated Act, along with the other requirements applicable to transitional activities. In the Commission's modelling for Paris-aligned pathways, natural gas is projected to represent 22% of gross inland energy consumption in 2030, and 9% in 2050. Any natural gas in 2050 will have to be abated.

The technical screening criteria ensure that any new gas-based power/heat plant (or refurbished combined heat and power plant or heat/cool plant) is either below the technology-neutral 100g CO2/kWh life-cycle emission threshold (i.e. using Carbon Capture and Storage technologies) or meets a number of stringent conditions and obtains a construction permit by 2030. Importantly, the use of gas should act as a replacement of plants running on more polluting solid and liquid fossil fuels (e.g. coal). As regards the co-generation of heat and power and heating/cooling activities, for every new natural gas-fired plant to be built, a coal-fired plant with the same capacity has to be removed for the technical screening criteria to be complied with. Regarding the power generation, the capacity of the gas-fired plant cannot exceed the capacity of the coal-fired plant by more than 15%. Facilities have to integrate a rapid conversion towards renewables with a clear commitment for a full switch to renewables by 2035.

### What activities and accompanying criteria does the Complementary Climate Delegated Act introduce?

Today's Complementary Climate Delegated Act:

  *  **introduces additional economic activities from the energy sector into the EU Taxonomy.  **The Delegated Act includes in particular certain nuclear energy activities that can play a role, under strict conditions regarding nuclear and environmental safety (also related to waste disposal), in the EU's transition towards climate neutrality. It also covers some gas energy activities as transitional activities, subject to specific conditions which recognise the role gas can play to help some regions transition from the most polluting solid fossil fuel energy sources, such as coal, to renewable energy.
  *  **introduces specific disclosure requirements for businesses related to their activities in the gas and nuclear energy sectors.  **Those requirements should further enhance the information provided to investors and improve transparency.



More specifically, this Complementary Climate Delegated Act covers the following activities:

 **Nuclear-related activities** :

  1. Advanced technologies with closed fuel cycle (“Generation IV”) to incentivise research and innovation into future technologies in terms of safety standards and minimising waste (with no sunset clause);
  2. New nuclear power plant projects for energy generation, which will be using best-available existing technologies (“Generation III+”), will be recognised until 2045 (date of approval of construction permit);
  3. Modifications and upgrades of existing nuclear installations for the purposes of lifetime extension, will be recognised until 2040 (date of approval by competent authority)



 **Gas-related**   **activities** :

Each gas-related activity needs to meet either of the following emission thresholds:

  * lifecycle emissions are below 100gCO2e/kWh, or
  * until 2030 (date of approval of construction permit), and where renewables are not available at sufficient scale, direct emissions are below 270gCO2e/kWh or, for the activity of electricity generation, their annual direct GHG emissions must not exceed an average of 550kgCO2e/kW of the facility's capacity over 20 years. In this case, the activity must meet a set of cumulative conditions: e.g. it replaces a facility using solid or liquid fossil fuels, the activity ensures a full switch to renewable or low-carbon gases by 2035, and a regular independent verification of compliance with the criteria is carried out.



### What are the amendments introduced to the Delegated Act on disclosures under Article 8 of the Taxonomy Regulation?

In order to provide a high degree of market transparency regarding investments in natural gas and nuclear energy activities covered by this Delegated Act, financial and non-financial companies should present specific disclosure requirements that would show to what degree gas and nuclear energy activities, complying with the technical screening criteria, is in the numerator and denominator of the key performance indicators of those undertakings. This should help investors to distinguish among activities they invest in. With the help of this specific disclosure requirement, investors that are not willing to invest in nuclear and gas activities under the conditions in this Delegated Act would be able to identify and invest in activities and financial products that have no exposures to economic activities in the nuclear and gas sectors.

In addition, in order to provide a high degree of transparency to investors in financial products concerning exposures to fossil gas and nuclear energy activities, the Commission will explore amending further the disclosure framework pertaining to those financial products as appropriate, to provide for full transparency over the whole life of those financial products. To ensure that such information is clearly identified by end-investors, the Commission will consider amending the requirements on the financial and insurance advice given by distributors.

## Taxonomy-Alignment Reporting

### What is the envisioned timeline for the application of Taxonomy-related disclosures set out in the Complementary Delegated Act (CDA)?

The CDA amends:

  * the Climate Delegated Act (DA) by adding specific new nuclear energy and fossil gas related economic activities to the EU Taxonomy, and 
  * the Disclosures Delegated Act by providing specific disclosure obligations related to those activities in new Article 8(6), (7) and (8) of that Delegated Act.



Article 3 of the CDA provides that the amendments contained therein start applying as of 1 January 2023. This implies that non-financial undertakings should disclose eligibility, non-eligibility, and alignment of nuclear energy and fossil gas related activities in accordance with Article 8(6), (7) and (8) of the amended Disclosures Delegated Act as of 1 January 2023(21)In accordance with the timeline in Article 10 to the Disclosures Delegated Act, also with respect to nuclear energy and fossil gas related activities, until 31 December 2023 financial undertakings shall only disclose the elements required under Article 10(3) pertaining to Taxonomy-eligibility and non-eligibility of nuclear and fossil gas related activities in templates 1, 4 and 5 of Annex XII of Disclosures Delegated Act pertaining to the reporting of Taxonomy-eligibility as referred to in Article 8(8) of the Disclsoures Delegated Act. Financial undertakings shall disclose as of 1 January 2024 also the ratios of Taxonomy-alignment of nuclear energy and fossil gas related activities in template 2 and 3 of Annex XII to the Disclosures Delegated Act as referred to in Article 8(8) of the Disclsoures Delegated Act. Financial undertakings shall compute nuclear energy and fossil gas-related activities in their KPIs by using the most recently available data and key performance indicators of their counterparties in accordance with the second subparagraph of Article 8(4) of the Disclosures Delegated Act.. The first reporting period concerns the (financial) year of 2022 in accordance with Article 8(2) of the Disclosures Delegated Act. 

### What is the envisioned approach for Taxonomy-related reporting in relation to the environmental objectives?

At the time of publication of this Notice, the Commission has not adopted a delegated regulation in accordance with Articles 12(2), 13(2), 14(2) or 15(2) of the Taxonomy Regulation establishing the TSC for economic activities related to non-climate environmental objectives.

Pursuant to Article 27(2)(b) in connection with Articles 4 to 8 of the Taxonomy Regulation, disclosures of reporting undertakings related to non-climate environmental objectives should in principle apply from 1 January 2023. Reporting undertakings cannot apply those disclosures on Taxonomy-alignment and Taxonomy-eligibility in the absence of a delegated regulation establishing those TSC. This is because:

\- Taxonomy-aligned economic activities are defined by reference to compliance, inter alia, with those criteria that should be established by the Commission in accordance with Article 10 (3), 11(3), 12(2), 13(2), 14(2) or 15(2) as referred to in point (d) of Article 3 of the Taxonomy Regulation, and 

\- Taxonomy-eligible economic activities are defined by the description of the economic activities in the delegated acts adopted pursuant to the above mentioned Articles. 

This implies that only the Taxonomy-eligibility and alignment of economic activities with climate objectives (CCM and CCA) may be considered, assessed and disclosed under the Disclosures Delegated Act before a delegated regulation adopted in accordance with Articles 12(2), 13(2), 14(2) or 15(2) of the Taxonomy Regulation becomes applicable.

Therefore, reporting eligibility and alignment by non-financial undertakings for the remaining four environmental objectives is not expected for reporting in 2023. 

### What is the impact of the CSRD on the scope of the reporting entities under the Disclosures Delegated Act?

In accordance with Article 8(1) of the Taxonomy Regulation, only undertakings which are subject to an obligation to publish non-financial information pursuant to Article 19a or Article 29(a) of the Accounting Directive (provisions introduced by the Non-Financial Reporting Directive (NFRD) -- are required to report their key performance indicators (KPIs) under Article 8 of the Taxonomy Regulation and the Disclosures Delegated Act(22)For more details, reference is made to the response to question 1 of the first Commission Notice..

Article 19a or Article 29a of the Accounting Directive have been amended by CSRD. Following the entry into force of the CSRD, the undertakings subject to the reporting obligation under Article 8 of the Taxonomy Regulation and Disclosures Delegated Act will be as follows(23)See Article 5 on Transposition of the CSRD.:

  * third-country undertakings that generated a net turnover of more than EUR 150 million in the Union for each of the last two consecutive financial years, and that have EU subsidiaries that are large undertakings or listed SMEs excluding micro undertakings, branches);
  * the same phased approach described above will apply to third-country undertakings with securities listed on the EU regulated markets, due to the fact that the CSRD has also amended Directive 2004/109/EC (Transparency Directive)(26)Directive 2004/109/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 15 December 2004 on the harmonisation of transparency requirements in relation to information about issuers whose securities are admitted to trading on a regulated market and amending Directive 2001/34/EC (OJ L 390, 31.12.2004, p. 38–57)..



### When and how should the Taxonomy disclosures be verified by external reviewers? How will this change with the application of CSRD?

Currently, the rules of the Accounting Directive on verification laid down in Articles 19a and 29a of the Taxonomy Regulation apply to Taxonomy disclosures(27)Article 8(1) of the Taxonomy Regulation clarifies that ‘any undertaking which is subject to an obligation to. A statutory auditor or audit firm should check, in accordance with national rules transposing the NFRD, whether the non-financial statement or the separate report referred to in paragraph (4) of Article 19a or paragraph (4) of Article 29(a) of NFRD, containing Taxonomy disclosures, has been provided. National legislation may require that this information is verified by an independent assurance services provider.

After the CSRD becomes applicable for financial years starting on or after 1 January 2024, following the phased timetable indicated in question 3, its rules on assurance pertaining to sustainability reporting under CSRD apply to the same extent to disclosures in accordance with the Disclosures Delegated Act.

According to the CSRD(28)Please see the response to Question 3 in this Notice which details phase-in of reporting standards under the CSRD., the statutory auditor or audit firm (or the independent assurance services provider, where allowed by the Member State concerned) should express an opinion based on a limited assurance engagement regarding the compliance of the sustainability reporting with the requirements of the CSRD, including, the compliance with the reporting requirements of Article 8 of the Taxonomy Regulation. 

In addition, the Climate Delegated Act requires specifically that for some activities compliance with TSC should be verified by an independent third party due to their complexity. For instance, quantified life-cycle greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions for several economic activities should be verified by an independent third party(29)See, for instance, recital (11) of the Climate Delegated Act and sections 3.6, 3.10, 3.13, 4,5, 4.6, 4.7, 4.18, 4.19, 4.22, 4.23 of Annex I to the Climate Delegated Act concerning manufacturing and energy related activities..

### Are undertakings established in EEA-countries obliged to report the Taxonomy-alignment of their economic activities?

The free movement of goods, services, capital, and persons is assured in the Single Market. The European Economic Area (EEA) is an area of free trade and free movement of people made up of the EU Member States, Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein. In principle, throughout the EEA, the same rules are applied to maintain a homogeneous market. Therefore, in the case of Taxonomy-reporting the same requirements should apply, subject to the incorporation of the rules in the EEA acquis. 

### How can entities ensure that their voluntary reporting of Taxonomy-alignment of their economic activities does not contradict or misrepresent mandatory disclosures set out in the Disclosures Delegated Act?

Voluntary reporting(30)Please see Question 7 of the first Commission Notice for more information about the concept of voluntary reporting. of Taxonomy-alignment by entities is a generic expression that may identify different possible situations, including but not limited to:

  * anticipated reporting of Taxonomy-alignment by entities not yet subject to mandatory Taxonomy-alignment reporting, but subject only to Taxonomy-eligibility reporting (e.g. reporting of Taxonomy-alignment ahead of the timeline provided in Article 10 of the Disclosures Delegated Act); 
  * reporting by entities not subject to any mandatory Taxonomy-reporting requirement under Article 8 of the Taxonomy Regulation, that is reporting by an entity not subject to obligation to publish non-financial information under NFRD/CSRD.



Reporting entities that are subject to Article 8 of the Taxonomy Regulation should clarify in all these cases the basis of preparation of the voluntary reporting, including that the anticipated reporting complies otherwise with the requirements set out in the Disclosure Delegated Act(31)For further detail see the Commission staff document _“FAQs: How should financial and non-financial undertakings report Taxonomy-eligible economic activities and assets in accordance with the Taxonomy Regulation Article 8 Disclosures Delegated Act?”_ , in particular footnote 35 as part of the answer to Question 31..

As regards reporting entities that are not subject to Article 8 of the Taxonomy Regulation, they are recommended to follow the same approach as for those subject to Article 8 of the Taxonomy Regulation (as set out above). 

When an undertaking makes publicly available this voluntary reporting in addition to mandatory reporting, it should be made clear how the two differ. As indicated in the response to question 7 of the first Commision Notice, voluntary reporting should not be given more prominence than the mandatory reporting and it should be prepared on a basis that does not contradict or misrepresent the mandatory information pursuant to the Disclosures Delegated Act(32)Further guidance on voluntary reporting and use of estimates for eligibility reporting in the first year(s) of. 

When entities make reference in their mandatory reporting to information from the voluntary Taxonomy-alignment reporting, they should, where available, also indicate the corresponding qualitative and/or quantitative information relating to the mandatory reporting. 

In publishing the voluntary Taxonomy reporting, entities should also take into account the content of ESMA’s Guidelines on Alternative Performance Measures (APM)(33)[ESMA/2015/1415en](https://www.esma.europa.eu/file/1689/download?token=J3T4keAi) – ESMA Guidelines on Alternative Performance Measures (APMs). and the related Q&As(34)<https://www.esma.europa.eu/> – Questions and answers on ESMA Guidelines on Alternative Performance Measures (APMs) – 1 April 2022 (please note that this document may be updated and therefore reference should always be made to the latest version of it available on the ESMA website at <https://www.esma.europa.eu/>)..

### How are reporting undertakings expected to disclose comparative information in the disclosures under the Disclosures Delegated Act?

In accordance with Article 8(3) of the Disclosures Delegated Act, in year N, the reporting undertaking must disclose the KPIs published in that year N and the KPIs published in year N-1. Furthermore, the second subparagraph ofthat provision clarifies that N-1, for which the first KPIs are published by non-financial undertakings, starts with year 2023. 

In accordance with Article 10(4) of the Disclosures Delegated Act, in 2023, reporting non-financial undertakings must disclose the first KPIs only, that is the KPIs relating to the reporting period 2022. 

In 2024, the reporting non-financial undertakings must disclose the KPIs for the reporting period 2023 and, as comparative information, the KPIs published in 2023 for the reporting period 2022. 

In 2024, the reporting financial undertaking must disclose the KPIs for the reporting period 2023 without comparative information. In 2025, the reporting financial and non-financial undertaking must publish the KPIs for the reporting period 2024 along with the previous year’s comparative KPIs i.e. KPIs published in 2024 for reporting period 2023 and so forth. 

### How should reporting undertakings address ‘double-counting’ in the context of business activities contributing to multiple environmental objectives?

### Contribution to climate change mitigation (CCM) and climate change adaptation (CCA)

Before TSC for substantial contribution of activities to non-climate environmental objectives are established by future delegated acts, only Taxonomy-alignment with climate-related objectives may be assessed and disclosed (CCM) andCCA). 

The contribution of a given activity to CCM or CCA should be assessed based on the nature of that activity. 

Regarding the CapEx KPI, and as mentioned in the last paragraph of Section 1.1.2.2 of Annex I to the Disclosures Delegated Act, the nature and scope of CapEx in an activity that contributes substantially to CCM could in some cases be differentiated – and hence easy to distinguish – from CapEx that make that activity adapted to climate change. This could be the case in situations where the adaptation solution is external to the CCM-aligned asset (i.e. a separately identifiable and implemented measure/project) or where a solution is specified in the adaptation plan of the existing activity/asset. For example, the CapEx to build an on-shore wind farm that is located near the sea shore, which should be assessed for CCM, should be distinguished from the CapEx to protect this wind farm from sea rises or sea-shore erosion, which should be assessed for CCA. 

On the other hand, where the adaptation solution is an inherent part of the design of the new asset that is itself CCM aligned(35)DNSH TSC to CCA require that, for new activities and existing activities using newly-built physical assets, the economic operator integrates the adaptation solutions that reduce the most important identified physical climate risks that are material to that activity at the time of design and construction and has implemented them before the start of operations., it could be difficult to distinguish CCA related CapEx from CCM related CapEx. In that case, CapEx under CCM could also cover the CapEx on the inherent adaptation solution. For example, a new off-shore wind farm would need to be designed to be resilient to the impacts of the rising seas (i.e. to fulfil DNSH to CCA) in order to be CCM aligned. It might be difficult for the operator to have knowledge of comparative CapEx of an off-shore windfarm that is not adapted to rising seas. In such situations, the CapEx should be reported under CCM objective only.

Regarding the turnover KPI, in accordance with the second paragraph of Section 1.1.1. of Annex I to the Disclosures Delegated Act, the revenue generated from an activity that is adapted to climate change may not be computed in the numerator of the turnover KPI of the undertaking unless that activity:

  * is an activity enabling CCA(36)Activities enabling substantial contribution to climate change adaptation such as certain types of engineering, insurance and education could report the turnover KPI for CCA but not for CCM because there are no SC criteria for CCM for such activities., or;
  * is aligned with CCM or any non-climate environmental objective. 



Thus, the turnover generated from an on-shore wind farm that is adapted to climate change may only be counted in the turnover KPI of the undertaking where that wind farm is Taxonomy-aligned with respect to CCM and should be reported under the CCM objective. The turnover KPI for adaptation would not be reported for activities that are only adapted. 

For adapted activities enabling a substantial contribution to CCA, the undertaking could count that respective turnover in the numerator of the turnover KPI under the CCA objective (column 6) with an E tag (column 20). Where such an activity also contributes substantially to CCM (e.g. afforestation), the undertaking could count that respective turnover in the numerator of the turnover KPI under the CCM objective (column 5)(37)Where the activity referred to in the previous sentence is not enabling, the turnover KPI under CCM objective should be reported on a separate line without the E tag. In all cases, the undertaking should avoid double counting in accordance with Section 1.2.2.2 of Annex I. KPI reported in column 4 should be the same figure as in column 18.. For example, a non-financial undertaking could report turnover from an afforestation activity in a location prone to risk of droughts with climate adapted trees (e.g. drought resistant trees) under the CCM objective (column 5) and report turnover from selling drought resistant seeds and saplings under the CCA objective (column 6). The undertaking should apply a similar approach to OpEx and report OpEx related to afforestation under CCM objective and OpEx related to selling adapted seeds and saplings under CCA objective.

### For activities contributing substantially to CCM, treatment of CapEx(38)Turnover of such an activity would be recognised in the numerator of the turnover KPI only after the activity becomes Taxonomy-aligned. to meet DNSH criteria for non-climate environmental objectives 

For activities contributing substantially to CCM, reporting undertakings may incur CapEx to meet DNSH criteria for non-climate environmental objectives. For example, a car manufacturer, which is operating a factory producing electric vehicles(39)See Climate Delegated Act, Annex I, Section 3.3. ’Manufacture of low carbon technologies for transport’., which meet substantial contribution (SC) criteria for CCM, may need to incur CapEx to meet DNSH criteria for the objectives of circular economy or pollution prevention in order to make the production of those vehicles Taxonomy-aligned. That CapEx should not be reported under those environmental objectives (column 8 or 9 of the template in Annex II) because, for those objectives, the activity only meets DNSH level of performance and no TSC for substantial contribution has yet been established for those objectives(40)Once TSC are established for SC towards those objectives, additional CapEx might be needed to make the activity contribute substantially towards those objectives.. Instead, that CapEx should be reported under the CCM objective (column 5 of the template in Annex II), because it is incurred in the context of making an activity contributing substantially to CCM a Taxonomy-aligned activity by meeting DNSH criteria for other objectives. 

### Treatment of an activity making substantial contribution to multiple environmental objectives (other than only to CCM and CCA) 

After TSC for economic activities contributing to environmental objectives are established in a future delegated act, some economic activities may be able to make a substantial contribution to multiple environmental objectives, other than only to CCM and CCA. 

The reporting of such activities under the Disclosures Delegated Act, in particular under Section 1.2.2.2. of Annex I, may be further clarified once the relevant TSC are established. 

### What should be the level of consolidation of KPIs of a parent undertaking with respect to (i) their third country subsidiaries and (ii) their activities/assets in third countries, or those of their EU subsidiaries? Where should KPIs be disclosed?

In accordance with point 2(f) of Annex I, the KPIs of undertakings shall be provided at the level of the individual undertaking where that undertaking prepares only individual non-financial statements, or at the level of the group where the undertaking prepares consolidated non-financial statements.

Articles 19a and 29a of NFRD determine whether reporting undertakings should prepare an individual or a consolidated non-financial statement, which shall include Taxonomy disclosures(41)See Question 1 of the first Commission Notice for more detail.. A reporting undertaking shall prepare an individual non-financial statement unless its parent undertaking prepares a non-financial statement at consolidated level that includes that undertaking. A parent undertaking shall prepare a consolidated non-financial statement unless its own parent includes that parent undertaking and its subsidiaries in a consolidated non-financial statement. 

Thus, for the purpose of providing consolidated KPIs, **** parent entities should consolidate:

  * all their subsidiaries, including third country subsidiaries, as per Chapter 6 of the Accounting Directive; 
  * all their activities (i.e. turnover, CapEx, OpEx) and assets and those of their EU and non-EU subsidiaries/entities, including those performed in third countries.



This implies that the consolidated net turnover, CapEx, OpEx pursuant to the Accounting Directive, should be used for the KPIs disclosed at the consolidated group level regardless of whether some portion of that net turnover, CapEx, OpEx take place in the EU or in a third country. 

This approach to consolidation does not change under the CSRD, which allows for a subsidiary undertaking to be exempted from preparing and publishing its sustainability reporting if that subsidiary undertaking and its subsidiary undertakings are included in the consolidated sustainability reporting of a parent undertaking prepared in accordance with ESRS or standards considered equivalent by a Commission implementing act. However, point (10) of Article 19a and point (9) of 29a of the CSRD explicitly exclude from this exemption large undertakings with securities admitted to trading on EU regulated markets. 

In addition, paragraph (1) of Article 19a and paragraph (1) of Article 29a of CSRD require that undertakings disclose their sustainability reporting in a clearly identified dedicated section of their management report or consolidated management report, respectively. The undertakings subject to CSRD will have to disclose their Taxonomy KPIs within that same dedicated section of the management report or consolidated management report. Under the new Article 29d of CSRD, undertakings subject to CSRD will have to prepare their management report in the machine-readable format specified by Commission Delegated Regulation 2019/815(42)Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2020/1989 of 6 November 2020 amending Delegated Regulation (EU) 2019/815 as regards the 2020 update of the taxonomy laid down in the regulatory technical standards for the single electronic reporting format (OJ L 429, 18.12.2020, p. 1–723). on the European Single Electronic Format (‘ESEF Regulation’), and mark-up the sustainability reporting section within their management report - including their Taxonomy KPIs – in accordance with the digital taxonomy to be adopted via an amendment to the ESEF Regulation. 

### What is the level of consolidation of KPIs of non-EU groups with a NFRD subsidiary in the EU?

Currently, a reporting undertaking that is a subsidiary of a non-EU parent should provide individual non-consolidated KPIs in its individual non-financial statement, pursuant to Article 19 a of NFRD. Where such subsidiary undertaking is a parent of other subsidiaries, it should provide KPIs that consolidate its subsidiaries in the consolidated non-financial statement pursuant to Article 29a of NFRD. Exemptions in paragraph (3) of Article 19a and paragraph (3) of Article 29a of NFRD only apply if the ultimate non-EU parent undertaking publishes a consolidated management report or a separate report, prepared in accordance with Article 29 and 19a or 29a of NFRD, including all relevant subsidiaries. 

Following the entry into application of CSRD(43)Reference is made to the description of the phased application in the reply to question 3 of this Notice., a subsidiary undertaking of a non-EU parent that is subject to Articles 19a and 29a will have to publish its sustainability reporting at a consolidated level, if that subsidiary is also a parent undertaking. This subsidiary undertaking will be exempt from publishing its sustainability reporting if that subsidiary undertaking and its subsidiary undertakings are included in the consolidated sustainability reporting of that non-EU parent undertaking prepared in accordance with EU Sustainability Reporting Standards (ESRS) or standards considered equivalent by a Commission implementing act. However, point (10) of Article 19a and point (9) of Article 29a of CSRD explicitly exclude from this exemption the large undertakings with securities admitted to trading on EU regulated markets.

During a 7-year transition period from the entry into force of CSRD, a reporting undertaking that is subject to Articles 19a or 29a of CSRD and that is a subsidiary of a non-EU parent may provide KPIs that consolidate all EU subsidiaries of the ultimate non-EU parent which are subject to Articles 19a or 29a in a consolidated sustainability report. This reporting undertaking must be one of the Union subsidiary undertakings of the group that generated the greatest turnover in the Union in at least one of the preceding five financial years (on a consolidated basis where applicable). After that transition period, the reporting EU subsidiary of a non-EU parent(44)Under the third subparagraph of Article 40a(1) of CSRD. will not be able to be exempted from publishing its sustainability reporting (at its own consolidated level if such subsidiary undertaking is also a parent) unless its non-EU parent publishes a consolidated sustainability reporting at the level of that non-EU parent (i.e. providing KPIs at the consolidated level of that non-EU parent), prepared in accordance with ESRS or equivalent standards.

### Can a subsidiary falling within scope of the NFRD/CSRD be exempted from making Taxonomy related disclosures if its parent undertaking discloses Taxonomy-related information at consolidated level where required or on a voluntary basis?

Currently, undertakings that are exempt from publishing non-financial information pursuant to paragraph (3) of Article 19a and paragraph (3) of Article 29a of NFRD are also exempted from making Taxonomy related disclosures under Article 8(1) of the Taxonomy Regulation, if the conditions in those provisions are met (i.e. the Taxonomy-related disclosure of the exempted undertaking is included in the consolidated non-financial statement, or a separate report, of another (parent) undertaking). 

Where the parent undertaking is not required to prepare a consolidated non-financial statement, or separate report, and only prepares it on a voluntary basis, the subsidiary cannot be exempted from making Taxonomy-related disclosures under the Disclosures Delegated Act, unless the parent undertaking publishes a consolidated management report that includes that subsidiary and that is prepared in accordance with Article 29 and 19a (or 29a if that undertaking is a parent undertaking). 

The CSRD contains similar exemptions in paragraph (9) of Article 19a and paragraph (8) of Article 29a:

  * a subsidiary undertaking is exempted if that undertaking and its subsidiary undertakings are included in the consolidated management report of a parent undertaking drawn up in accordance with the provisions of CSRD, and if the additional conditions set out in point (9) of Article 19a are met. The exemption also covers the case where the subsidiary undertaking is a subsidiary of a non-EU undertaking. 
  * a parent undertaking is exempted if that parent undertaking and its subsidiaries are included in the consolidated management report of another undertaking, drawn up in accordance with the provisions of CSRD and additional requirements set out in point (8) of Article 29(a) are met. The exemption also covers the case where the parent undertaking is a subsidiary of a non-EU undertaking.



Large undertakings with securities admitted to trading on EU regulated markets are excluded from the exemption (paragraph (10) of Article 19a and paragraph (9) of Article 29a to the CSRD).

### Where a reporting undertaking is required to provide consolidated KPIs, should it also provide KPIs of its subsidiaries?

Article 29a of the Accounting Directive requires parent undertakings of large groups to publish a consolidated sustainability reporting at the level of the group. The objective is to report information necessary to understand the group's impacts on sustainability matters, and information necessary to understand how sustainability matters affect the group's development, performance and position. 

Under paragraph (4) of Article 29a of the CSRD, if the parent undertaking identifies significant differences between the risks or impacts of the group and the risks or impacts of one or more of its subsidiaries, the parent must provide an adequate understanding of the risks and impacts of these subsidiaries. The parent undertakings must also indicate which subsidiaries included in the consolidation are exempted from annual or consolidated sustainability reporting pursuant to paragraph (9) of Article 19a or paragraph (8) of Article 29a respectively. In such situations, the consolidated sustainability reporting should also provide subsidiary level Taxonomy KPIs in the contextual information.

### Is there any minimum turnover, CapEx and OpEx threshold below which undertakings are not obliged to report Taxonomy-eligibility or alignment of their economic activities (‘materiality thresholds’)?

According to Article 8(2) of the Taxonomy Regulation, undertakings subject to the NFRD/ CSRD) are under the obligation to report the proportion of their turnover, CapEx and OpEx associated with Taxonomy-aligned economic activities. The Disclosures Delegated Act specifies further the content and presentation of the relevant information to be reported. No exemption is foreseen from the obligation to report.

Section 1.1.3.2. of Annex I provides for a certain degree of flexibility in the reporting of the OpEx KPI where the OpEx is considered as _“not material”_ for the business model of a non-financial undertaking. In this situation, the reporting undertaking:

  * is exempted from the calculation of the numerator of the OpEx KPI and disclose that numerator as being equal to zero; 
  * disclose the total value of the OpEx denominator;
  * explain the absence of materiality of OpEx (i.e. of the total OpEx, corresponding to the denominator, as defined by Disclosures Delegated Act) in their business model.



As a result, companies with no or little eligible OpEx (numerator) but with significant total OpEx (denominator) should not use the exemption.

The exemption from the calculation of the OpEx KPI does not, however, amount to an exemption to disclose information in its entirety, given that reporting undertakings are still required to provide an explanation about the absence of materiality of OpEx in their particular business model.

### How should turnover, CapEx, OpEx of joint ventures be treated for the reporting of Taxonomy-related KPIs?

In accordance with IFRS 11, a joint venture is a joint arrangement whereby the parties that have joint control of the arrangement have rights to the net assets of the arrangement. In accordance with IFRS 11, interest in joint ventures is recognised as an investment and accounted for using the equity method in accordance with IAS 28 _Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures,_ unless the entity is exempted from applying the equity method as specified in that standard (IFRS 11, paragraph 24). 

However, to help reporting undertakings provide an accurate picture of their Taxonomy-aligned investments, and in accordance with Section 1.2.3 of Annex I, non-financial undertakings may disclose, on a voluntary basis, additional KPIs based on turnover, CapEx, OpEx that include investments in equity accounted in joint ventures, pursuant to IFRS 11 or IAS 28, on a pro rata basis corresponding to their share in the equity of the joint venture. 

### How should reporting undertakings account for hedging instruments (including forward sales of power)?

The turnover amount reported should be the same as that accounted for under IAS 1.82(a). Changes in fair value of hedging instruments used under a qualified hedging relationship under IFRS 9 can affect the amount of the turnover where the hedged item is the turnover. This adjustment, however, is not accounted as part of IAS 1.82(a), but is a gain or loss from hedging instrument and therefore it is not part of the turnover KPI.

### How should the KPIs be adjusted by non-financial undertakings to take account of the environmentally sustainable bonds that they issued with the view of avoiding ‘double-counting’? How should environmentally sustainable bonds / debt securities and the linked double counting issues be treated?

The Disclosures Delegated Act requires financial undertakings to use KPIs of non-financial undertakings when including exposures to those non-financial companies in their GAR/GIR, except for certain exposures where the use of proceeds is known to be Taxonomy-aligned, e.g. sustainability bonds issued by the non-financial undertakings. Sustainability bonds can count in the numerator of GAR/GIR up to the amount of Taxonomy-aligned expenditures paid from the bond proceeds, i.e. above the company level KPI percentage and potentially up to 100% of the exposure to sustainability bonds. 

Where the proceeds from the sustainability bond are used to pay for Taxonomy-aligned CapEx, such Capex is already reflected in the GAR/GIR(45)The financial undertaking discloses GAR/GIR are based on turnover KPIs of investee undertakings and GAR/GIR based on CapEx KPIs of those undertakings in accordance with Section 1.2 of Annex III, point (a) of the fourth paragraph of section 1.2.1 of Annex V, first paragraph. of the financial undertaking. On the other hand, this CapEx is part of the undertaking’s CapEx KPI and would be counted in the GAR/GIR of the financial undertaking for a second time as part of calculation of the financial undertaking’s KPI based on the CapEx KPIs of investee undertakings. To avoid double counting, financial undertakings should use an adjusted CapEx KPI that the non-financial undertaking should disclose alongside their non-adjusted KPIs(46)last paragraph of Article 7(4) of the Disclosures Delegated Act.. 

This Taxonomy-aligned CapEx, that was paid from the proceeds of the sustainable bond, represents creation of, or addition to, Taxonomy-aligned assets/equipment that could be used in the production process to produce Taxonomy-aligned output and hence turnover. That Taxonomy-aligned turnover would be part of the non-financial undertaking’s turnover KPI. Consequently, the same Taxonomy-aligned turnover would be reflected in financial undertaking’s GAR/GIR on the one hand through the inclusion of the sustainability bond directly in the GAR/GIR and, on the other hand, would be counted in the GAR/GIR a second time by including other exposures, multiplied by the turnover KPI, to that non-financial undertaking. To avoid double counting, financial undertakings should use an adjusted turnover KPI that the non-financial undertaking should, until the maturity of the sustainable bond, disclose alongside their non-adjusted KPIs.

Regarding the disclosure of CapEx and/or OpEx KPIs, non-financial undertakings that issued use of proceeds sustainable bond(s) that finance part or all of their CapEx and/or, where relevant, OpEx during the reporting period, should disclose also adjusted CapEx and/or OpEx KPIs so that financial undertakings avoid double-counting that CapEx and/or OpEx in their other exposures to non-financial undertaking(47)See the last paragraphs of section 1.2.3.2 of Annex I. In the adjusted Capex and OpEx KPIs, a portion of Taxonomy-aligned CapEx and/or OpEx, incurred during the reporting period, that is paid with the proceeds from the issuance of use of proceeds sustainable bonds should be deducted from the numerator of the adjusted CapEx and/or OpEx KPIs.

Similarly for turnover KPIs, non-financial undertakings that issue use of proceeds sustainable bond(s) that fund (a portion of) Taxonomy-aligned assets (and their associated CapEx and OpEx) that are employed in production of Taxonomy-aligned turnover during the reporting period, should, until the maturity of the sustainable bond(s), disclose also adjusted turnover KPIs(48)See the last paragraph of section 1.2.3.1. of Annex I. In the adjusted turnover KPI, a portion of Taxonomy-aligned turnover should be deducted from the numerator of the turnover KPI which corresponds to the proportion of Taxonomy-aligned assets that were funded with the proceeds of sustainable bond(s).

### How should a reporting undertaking treat the turnover and CapEx from disposal groups and discontinued operations and in the context of IFRS 5?

The accounting treatment referred to in Sections 1.1.1. and 1.1.2. of Annex I should be applied. While revenue from discontinued operations needs to be presented separately from continuing operations (IFRS 5.33) and, therefore, cannot be included in the revenue line item as required by IAS 1.82(a), revenue from non-current assets or disposal groups classified as held for sale remains part of the continuing operations and, therefore, is included in the revenue line item as required by IAS 1.82(a). 

Assets that are part of non-current assets or disposal groups classified as held for sale or a discontinued operation must be reclassified according to IFRS 5 and reported together in a separate balance sheet item. Until the date of IFRS 5 classification or, in the case of non-current assets or disposal groups classified as held for sale, also after this date, additions to the balance sheet that generally meet the CapEx definition, can be made within the financial year. In the case of non-current assets or disposal groups classified as held for sale and discontinued operation, all additions that meet the Capex definition must be taken into account in the calculation of the CapEx KPI.

In addition, the reporting entities should provide contextual information pursuant to Section 1.2.3. of Annex I concerning any current and future impact from non-current assets or disposal groups classified as held for sale and discontinued operations on the turnover KPI and CapEx KPI. 

### How should reporting undertakings assess the Taxonomy-eligibility of economic activities for climate change adaptation (CCA) under Article 11(1)(a) of the Taxonomy Regulation?

The Taxonomy-eligibility of activities for climate change mitigation (CCM) or enabling climate change adaptation (see question 19 of this Notice), may be assessed solely based on the description of the activity, irrespective of whether the activity meets the TSC (in line with the replies to questions 3 and 9 of the first Commission Notice).  

  

With respect to adapted activities (see questions 8 and 19 of this Notice), for assessing the Taxonomy-eligibility of activities for CCA in accordance with Article 11(1)(a) of the Taxonomy Regulation, the title or the description of the economic activity spelled out in Annex II to the Climate Delegated Act is not decisive in itself for making a substantial contribution to CCA. A reporting undertaking should rather consider the adaptation solutions that it puts in place that could make the economic activity adapted/more resilient to climate change. In line with the reply to question 5 of the first Commission Notice, to demonstrate the Taxonomy-eligibility of an activity, an undertaking has to perform a climate risk and vulnerabilities assessment of the most important physical climate risks that are material to its economic activity. In addition, the undertaking must put in place a plan outlining how and by when adaptation solutions will be put in place to counter these physical risks. For instance, if a manufacturer of cement identifies that its manufacturing site is prone to avalanches, the entity may put in place a plan to install structural protection measures to hold back avalanches, such as avalanche barriers or snow racks. The existence of such a plan based on a climate risk and vulnerabilities assessment makes the economic activity Taxonomy-eligible for CCA. This Taxonomy-eligibility does not require the economic activity to meet all the TSC for CCA, i.e. to ensure that the adaptation solutions have already been implemented. 

### What is the Taxonomy-aligned share of turnover and corresponding CapEx/OpEx from activities listed in Annex II to the Climate Delegated Act?

Annex II to the Climate Delegated Act distinguishes between three types of economic activities eligible for climate change adaptation (CCA):   

  1.  **Adapted activities** : 



These are economic activities that can make a substantial contribution to CCA by being made climate resilient/adapted. This implies putting in place adaptation solutions that can counter the most important physical climate risks that threaten the activity, as identified in a climate risk and vulnerability assessment. These activities qualify as Taxonomy-aligned where they meet points 1 to 4 in the generic substantial contribution criteria for adaptation. For instance, if a manufacture of cement identifies that its manufacturing site is prone to avalanches, the entity may put in place a plan to install structural protection measures to hold back avalanches, such as avalanche barriers or snow racks. For these activities, only the CapEx and OpEx associated with putting in place the adaptation solutions can count as Taxonomy-aligned. The turnover of that activity may only be considered as Taxonomy-aligned if the activity itself is also Taxonomy-aligned (see Section 1.1.1 of Annex I) with respect to climate change mitigation (CCM) and then it should be counted towards the CCM objective only, or, when a delegated regulation adopted in accordance with Articles 12(2), 13(2), 14(2) or 15(2) of the Taxonomy Regulation enters into force, any other environmental objective (see replies to questions 5 and 8 of the first Commission Notice). Otherwise, these activities can only be reported under CapEx and OpEx KPIs.

 

  1.  **Enabling activities** : 



These are activities that can make a substantial contribution by providing adaptation solutions themselves that can enable another economic activity to reach a substantial contribution to one of the six environmental objectives referred to in Article 9 of the Taxonomy Regulation. The enabling character of these activities is explicitly stated in their description(49)The following sentence is added in the description of the activity: _”An economic activity in this category is an enabling activity as referred to in Article 11(1) point (b) of Regulation (EU) 2020/852 where it meets the technical screening criteria set out this section.”_. In addition, they do not follow the generic criteria of substantial contribution to CCA. These activities are limited to the following activities listed in Annex II to the Climate Delegated Act:   

  *     *  _9.1. Engineering activities and related technical consultancy dedicated to adaptation to climate change;   _
    *  _9.2. Close to market research, development and innovation;  _
    *  _10.1. Non-life insurance: underwriting of climate-related perils;  _
    *  _10.2. Reinsurance.  _



For these activities the turnover, CapEx and OpEx associated with meeting the TSC set out in Annex II to the Climate Delegated Act can count as Taxonomy-aligned. 

  1.  **Adapted-enabling activities** : 



These are economic activities that combine the types 1 and 2 outlined above as they can make a substantial contribution to CCA by:

  * becoming adapted themselves (adapted activity), and 
  * enabling other activities to make a substantial contribution (enabling activity).



These activities are identified by the following sentence in the description of the activity “ _Where an economic activity in this category complies with the substantial contribution criterion specified in point 5, the activity is an enabling activity as referred to in Article 11(1), point (b), of Regulation (EU) 2020/852, provided that it meets the technical screening criteria set out in this Section_ ” . The activities that fall under this type must comply with the generic criteria for substantial contribution to CCA set out in Annex II to the Climate Delegated Act with additional criteria related to the enabling character. Therefore, if the activity meets points 1 to 4 of the criteria for substantial contribution, it can qualify as an adapted activity. If it meets, in addition, point 5 of those criteria, the activity can also qualify as enabling. However, the activity first needs to be adapted itself to qualify as enabling. For instance, a school that is prone to subsidence may put in place concrete underpinning or jet grouting to make it resilient to climate change, therefore qualifying as an adapted activity. In addition, the school may offer some climate-related courses, which may stimulate individual climate action. 

 

For these activities, the CapEx and OpEx associated with putting in place the adaptation solutions to make it climate resilient can count as Taxonomy-aligned with respect to CCA(50)Sections 1.1.2.2, final paragraph, and Section 1.1.3.2, fourth paragraph of Annex I. (in the above example, the CapEx for the concrete underpinning or jet grouting). In addition, the turnover and associated CapEx and OpEx of providing the adaption solution itself (e.g. climate related courses) can count as Taxonomy-aligned with respect to CCA.  

### When should an undertaking be required to report under the Disclosures Delegated Act an economic activity that has not been performed by the reporting entity itself but by a subcontractor?

Reporting entities must report turnover from the activities performed by a subcontractor in accordance with the accounting treatment referred to in Section 1.1.1. of Annex I of the Disclosures Delegated Act. Therefore, the reporting entity should determine whether it recognises revenue arising from that activity as its own revenue under the principles set out in the applicable IFRS 15. Where revenue generated by a subcontractor is recognised as the revenue of the reporting entity, it must be included in the calculation of the turnover KPI.

As an example: An entity is an actor in the logistics industry, and it provides freight transport services by road to its customers (activity 6.6 “ _freight transport services by road”_ described in the Climate Delegated Act as _“purchase, financing, leasing, rental and operation of vehicles designated as…”_ ). To deliver such transportation services, the entity either owns directly and operates some vehicles, or it outsources a portion of its activities by contracting with subcontractors or third party transport providers to provide the transport services to its customers, without puchasing, leasing, or operating directly the designated vehicles. 

Turnover is generated for the whole activity of transportation services independently of how (by whom) the services are performed; an outsourced activity is part of the general activity 6.6 “ _freight transport services by road”_ even if the entity does not purchase, rent nor directly operate the vehicles. For this outsourced portion of activities, the turnover KPI to be considered for Taxonomy disclosures is the one derived from the financial statements in accordance with IFRS 15.34 to B3.

Where the entity is determined as being a principal in the satisfaction of the performance obligations in the financial statements, it recognises revenue in the gross amount of consideration to which it expects to be entitled in exchange for the specified good or service transferred. When an entity that is an agent satisfies the performance obligation, it recognises revenue in the amount of any fee or commission to which it expects to be entitled in exchange for arranging for the specified goods or services to be provided by the other party. As indicated in Section 1.1.1 of Annex 1 of the Disclosures Delegated Act, the turnover shall cover the revenue recognised pursuant to IAS 1.82 (a).

### How should reporting undertakings disclose turnover from Taxonomy-aligned economic activities whose output is used or consumed internally?

The disclosure of data under Section 1.2.3.1 point (b) of Annex I on _“the amounts related to taxonomy aligned activities pursued for non-financial undertakings’ own internal consumption”,_ is an element of contextual information allowing reporting undertakings to explain whether and how the outputs of internal sales or consumption of Taxonomy-aligned economic activities have evolved over the reporting period, alongside the main drivers and elements of change in their turnover KPI(51)The cost of internal sales/consumption of Taxonomy-aligned activities may qualify as OpEx under point (c) of section 1.1.3.2 of Annex I.. This information allows reporting undertakings to disclose where and how outputs of Taxonomy-aligned economic activities (e.g. Taxonomy-aligned renewable energy) may have been diverted for internal consumption and consequently, do not feature in their turnover KPI, which only records external sales.

### How should reporting undertakings allocate the turnover to economic activities which provide multiple services or products to customers?

The accounting treatment referred to in Section 1.1.1. of Annex I must be applied. In particular, IFRS 15 sets out criteria for the recognition of revenue on the basis of the performance obligations satisfied by the reporting entity, including cases in which multiple performance obligations constitute one single bundle to which revenue is entirely allocated. For the purpose of reporting the turnover KPI, those criteria should be followed to determine how to allocate revenue to different economic activities when multiple performance obligations are satisfied for the same customer or group of customers.

For example, an entity enters a contract to build a renewable energy production infrastructure for a customer. The entity is responsible for the overall management of the project and identifies various promised good or services, including engineering, site clearance, foundation, procurement, construction of the structure, installation of equipment and technologies, and finishing. The allocation of the turnover from this project to different economic activities follows the analysis that has been made in the financial statements in accordance with IFRS 15, i.e. depending on whether the goods and services are distinct or not from the accounting perspective. If the goods and services are distinct, the turnover is split into and allocated to the corresponding underlying economic activities.

### How should reporting undertakings treat public funding and subsidies received to finance their CapEx?

The source of financing (e.g. public or private, external or internal to the undertaking, or their combination) of the CapEx of non-financial undertakings has no relevance for the purpose of assessing the Taxonomy-alignment of that CapEx. Reporting undertakings should consider all their CapEx for the purpose of assessing its Taxonomy-alignment regardless of the source of its financing.

### At what point in time does the five to ten year-period of the CapEx plan commence for non-financial undertakings for the purposes of reporting? Does this time period apply both to a plan to expand a Taxonomy-aligned economic activity as well as to upgrade a Taxonomy-eligible economic activity into a Taxonomy-aligned economic activity?

The five to ten-year time period for the CapEx plan referred to in Section 1.1.2.2 of Annex I should start from its approval by the management body, or by another body approving it by delegation. The time period applies both to a plan to expand an undertaking’s Taxonomy-aligned economic activities and to a plan to upgrade or commence Taxonomy-eligible economic activities with a view to rendering them Taxonomy-aligned. 

### What is the beginning of the 18 month-period for the completion of individual measures referred to in point (c) of Section 1.1.2.2 of Annex I?

The start date of individual measures **** referred to in point (c) of Section 1.1.2.2 of Annex I should be aligned with the moment in time when accounting rules (for example, in IAS 16(7) for tangible assets and IAS 38(21) for intangible assets) recognise the associated CapEx in the financial statement and not at the point when the contract for the delivery of the Taxonomy-aligned output, service or measure is concluded.

### How comprehensive and precise should a CapEx plan be to be counted in the numerator of the CapEx KPI? Would the expansion of an existing Taxonomy-aligned economic activity in the same facility count as CapEx under point (a) or (b) of Section 1.1.2.2. of Annex I?

The CapEx plan referred to in Section **** 1.1.2.2. of Annex I should identify all planned measures that are necessary to ensure compliance of the economic activity with the TSC and include a description of those measures, expenditures related to those measures and their timing, including significant intermediary milestones, to allow effective monitoring by investors of the implementation of the investment plan(52)It is recommended that undertakings integrate their CapEx plans into their transition plans referred to in CSRD.. Expenditures which are not related to ensuring that the activity meets the criteria, e.g. decorative aspects of the facility in which the activity is performed with no bearing on environmental performance should not be included. OpEx which is necessary to ensure the effective functioning and day-to-day servicing of Taxonomy-aligned assets should be included as relevant in the OpEx plan in accordance with points (a) and (b) of Section 1.1.3.2 of Annex I. 

In order to determine whether the expansion of an existing Taxonomy-aligned economic activity would count as CapEx under point (a) or (b) of Section 1.1.2.2. of Annex I, one should consider when the expansion would be completed and become operational in relation to the moment where its related CapEx is incurred. If the expansion becomes operational in the same financial period when all the CapEx related to it is incurred, it could be counted under point (a) of Section 1.1.2.2. (i.e. there is no need to use the CapEx plan for the expansion). On the other hand, where the expansion takes place over several financial periods, CapEx will be incurred in financial periods before the expansion is completed. In order to count that CapEx as Taxonomy-aligned in the financial period when it was incurred while the expansion is not yet completed, the undertaking should use the CapEx plan under point (b) of Section 1.1.2.2. The purpose of the CapEx plan is to provide a degree of assurance that the expanded activity will be Taxonomy-aligned when completed and allow, on that basis, to count CapEx as already Taxonomy-aligned while incurred in the periods before the expansion is completed. In both cases, after completion, the expanded activity needs to meet the relevant TSCs. 

### How should the Taxonomy-aligned value of CapEx be presented on points (a), (b) and (c) of Section 1.1.2.2 of Annex I?

In line with Section 1.2.3.2. “ _Contextual information about CapEx KPI”_ of Annex I, different CapEx items under points (a), (b) and (c) of Section 1.1.2.2 of Annex I related to Taxonomy-aligned economic activities must be presented at activity-level. This means that relevant values of different CapEx items are to be presented in an aggregate form with respect to an activity. In the case of an undertaking with multiple Taxonomy-eligible/aligned economic activities, the presentation must make clear to which activity a CapEx item relates. Where individual values of relevant Taxonomy-aligned CapEx according to points (a), (b) and (c) of Section 1.1.2.2 of Annex I could be distinguished, reporting undertakings could choose to itemise them as such in the template in Annex II under one relevant activity. The total value of relevant Taxonomy-aligned CapEx for a relevant activity must be the sum of the items in points (a), (b) and (c) of Section 1.1.2.2 across relevant Taxonomy-aligned activities. The values of the different items should also be appropriately explained as part of the specifications and contextual information required under Section 1.2 of Annex I.

### What is the scope of the CapEx and OpEx referred to in points (c) of Section 1.1.2.2 and Section 1.1.3.2 of Annex I, i.e. purchase of Taxonomy-aligned output and individual measures?

Reference is made to explanations provided in the reply to the question 11 of the first Commission Notice concerning the activities/measures that are in the scope of the CapEx and OpEx referred to in point (c) of Section 1.1.2.2 and Section 1.1.3.2, respectively(53)In the third paragraph of the response to the question 11 of the First Commission Notice, the reference to Section 1.1.3.2 is meant to refer to Section 1.1.2.2 of Annex I.. For the purpose of this question in this Notice, the references to Taxonomy-eligibility in that reply should be read as references to Taxonomy-alignment.

As economic activities listed in the delegated acts adopted pursuant to Article 10(3), Article 11(3), Article 12(2), Article 13(2), Article 14(2) and Article 15(2) of the Taxonomy Regulation are added over time to the EU Taxonomy, the scope of the relevant activities/measures may expand. 

### How should CapEx and OpEx integrated in value chains be disclosed in the situation where the reporting undertaking is performing both the upstream and the downstream Taxonomy-eligible economic activity?

In the situation where an intermediate upstream activity is defined in the Climate Delegated Act as a standalone activity, the CapEx or OpEx associated with that activity should be assessed independently from the use of the output resulting from that activity for another downstream activity that is also defined in the Climate Delegated Act. For instance, if an undertaking produces cement (activity listed in Section 3.7 of Annex I to Climate Delegated Act) and it is using that cement for the construction of a building, the CapEx associated with meeting the TSC for cement is Taxonomy-aligned regardless of whether the construction of the building is Taxonomy-aligned. Reference is also made to question 21 of this Notice regarding how undertakings should disclose turnover from Taxonomy-aligned economic activities whose output is used or consumed internally.

### How should CapEx be assessed with regard to Taxonomy-alignment if the asset that the CapEx is financing might be used for various projects?

To avoid greenwashing and provide for an accurate reporting, it is necessary to only allocate the proportion of CapEx which is effectively assisting Taxonomy-aligned economic activities. Reporting entities should use a non-financial metric that provides for an accurate allocation of the CapEx to a Taxonomy-aligned activity. For instance, if the asset that is financed by CapEx produces 100 units of output that are Taxonomy-aligned and 100 units of output that are not Taxonomy-aligned, the reporting undertaking could report 50% of that CapEx as Taxonomy-aligned. The methodology used to allocate CapEx to Taxonomy-aligned activities should be based on verifiable evidence. 

The reporting undertaking should also provide contextual information under Section 1.2.3 of Annex I concerning:

  * the allocation of CapEx to multiple projects, and
  * the methodology to allocate the CapEx to Taxonomy-aligned activities.



### Can prepayments be counted as part of Taxonomy-aligned CapEx?

The costs to be considered for inclusion in the CapEx KPI are those listed in Section 1.1.2. of Annex I. The inclusion of these costs shall follow the timing of the recognition requirements as per the related accounting standards, as such prepayments should not be considered as giving rise to costs that are Taxonomy-eligible or aligned until the related elements of CapEx are recognised pursuant to the relevant accounting standards.

### How should research and development be accounted in the numerator of the OpEX KPI where it cannot be linked to specific activities?

Point (a) of Section 1.1.3.2 of Annex I requires that the OpEx concerning research and development must be _“associated with Taxonomy-aligned economic activities”_ to be included in the numerator of the OpEx KPI. Therefore, if research and development cannot be associated with Taxonomy-aligned economic activities, it may not be accounted in the numerator of the OpEx KPI. If R&D is used for both Taxonomy-aligned and non Taxonomy-aligned activities, the costs for R&D should be included in the numerator of the OpEx KPI based on its pro-rata contribution to the Taxonomy-aligned activities (see reply to question 26 in this Notice). 

### How should OpEx categories referred to in points (a) to (c) in Section 1.1.3.2. of Annex I (OpEx Numerator) be understood and treated in the numerator and denominator of the OpEx KPI?

The OpEx categories referred to in points (a) to (c) in Section 1.1.3.2 of Annex I that are part of the numerator of the OpEx KPI should also be accounted for in the denominator of the OpEx KPI.

### To which elements of the definition of the denominator of OpEx KPI does the notion of “maintenance and repair, and any other direct expenditures relating to the day-to-day servicing of assets of property, plant and equipment” refer under Section 1.1.3.1 of Annex I?

Maintenance and repair, and any other direct expenditures in the denominator of the OpEx KPI relate principally to physical assets. However, maintenance and repair or other direct costs could be also relevant for intangible assets (e.g. right-of-use assets, software). As such, all those costs should be part of the denominator of the OpEx KPI.

## Taxonomy-Eligibility reporting (part 2)

### To what undertakings does the reporting obligation under the Taxonomy Regulation Article 8 Delegated Act apply?

The Delegated Act supplementing Article 8 of the Taxonomy Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2021/2178) (“the Disclosures Delegated Act”) sets out specific requirements for Taxonomy-related reporting by undertakings covered by Directive EU 2014/95 (the Non-Financial Reporting Directive) (2)Directive 2014/95/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 October 2014 amending Directive 2013/34/EU as regards disclosure of non-financial and diversity information by certain large undertakings and groups, OJ L 330, 15.11.2014, p. 1.. 

Specifically, Article 8(1) of Regulation EU 2020/852(3)Regulation (EU) 2020/852 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 June 2020 on the establishment of a framework to facilitate sustainable investment, and amending Regulation (EU) 2019/2088, OJ L 198, 22.6.2020, p. 13. (the Taxonomy Regulation) contains a cross reference to Articles 19a and 29a of Directive EU 2013/34(4)Directive 2013/34/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 June 2013 on the annual financial statements, consolidated financial statements and related reports of certain types of undertakings, amending Directive 2006/43/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council and repealing Council Directives 78/660/EEC and 83/349/EEC, OJ L 182, 29.6.2013, p. 19. (the Accounting Directive) which were introduced by Directive EU 2014/95 (the Non-Financial Reporting Directive (NFRD)). More precisely, the Taxonomy Regulation specifies that ‘ _any undertaking which is subject to an obligation to publish non-financial information pursuant to Article 19a or Article 29a of Directive 2013/34/EU shall include in its non-financial statement or consolidated non-financial statement information on how and to what extent the undertaking’s activities are associated with economic activities that qualify as environmentally sustainable under Articles 3 and 9 of this Regulation_ '. In other words, undertakings that are subject to mandatory reporting obligations under the Accounting Directive, also have reporting obligations under the Taxonomy Regulation .

.

In accordance with Articles 19a and 29a of the Accounting Directive, the following undertakings are subject to the obligation to publish non-financial information: a large undertaking as defined in Article 3(4) of that Directive which is a public-interest entity as defined in Article 2 point (1) of that Directive with more than 500 employees on average during the financial year; and a public-interest entity which is a parent undertaking of a large group as defined in Article 3(7) of that Directive with more than 500 employees on average on a consolidated basis during the financial year. Based on Article 8(1) of the Taxonomy Regulation, such undertakings are also subject to the Taxonomy Regulation related disclosure obligations. 

Article 8(1) of the Taxonomy Regulation does not specifically refer to national measures transposing the NFRD that potentially extend the scope of its application to cover other categories of smaller undertakings. Therefore, the reporting requirements under Article 8(1) of the Taxonomy Regulation apply to undertakings directly in the scope of the NFRD. They do not apply to those undertakings covered only by national law transposing the NFRD. However, under the Disclosures Delegated Act, undertakings covered only by national law transposing the NFRD can report their alignment with the Taxonomy voluntarily.

### How is an 'economic activity' defined in the Disclosures Delegated Act?

The Taxonomy Regulation lays down a classification of environmentally sustainable economic activities. This classification is largely based on the Nomenclature of Economic Activities (NACE), the statistical classification of economic activities in the EU. 

An economic activity takes place when resources such as capital, goods, labour, manufacturing techniques or intermediary products are combined to produce specific goods or services. It is characterised by an input of resources, a production process and an output of products (goods or services). 

Regulation EU 2021/2139 (the Climate Delegated Act)(5)Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2021/2139 of 4 June 2021 supplementing Regulation (EU) 2020/852 of the European Parliament and of the Council by establishing the technical screening criteria for determining the conditions under which an economic activity qualifies as contributing substantially to climate change mitigation or climate change adaptation and for determining whether that economic activity causes no significant harm to any of the other environmental objectives, OJ L 442, 9.12.2021, p. 1. describes and assigns criteria on a high level. It does not refer to only one specific economic activity, but rather to categories of economic activities. For example, it sets criteria for the general category ‘manufacture of cement’, rather than the manufacturing of cement in one specific plant by one specific operator. 

The reference to NACE sectors in the Climate Delegated Act is only indicative and not necessarily exhaustive. Therefore, an economic activity could match the description of an activity and the technical screening criteria laid out the Climate Delegated Act (Annexes I and II thereof) even if the NACE sector of the company is not listed in the relevant section of the Climate Delegated Act. 

### What is a Taxonomy-eligible economic activity?

Article 1(5) of the Disclosures Delegated Act defines an eligible economic activity as an activity that is described in the delegated acts adopted under Article 10(3), Article 11(3), Article 12(2), Article 13(2), Article 14(2) and Article 15(2) of the Taxonomy Regulation. For the reporting period ending in 2022 (and for activities conducted in 2021), this definition corresponds to economic activities described in the Climate Delegated Act as adopted on 4 June 2021. 

More specifically, according to Article 1(5) of the Disclosures Delegated Act, an economic activity is eligible irrespective of whether it meets any or all of the technical screening criteria laid down in the Climate Delegated Act (and future delegated acts). Therefore, the fact that an economic activity is Taxonomy-eligible does not give any indication of the environmental performance and sustainability of that activity. 

In principle, if an undertaking generates turnover or invests in capital expenditure (CapEx) or operating expenditure (OpEx) corresponding to an economic activity that is described in the Climate Delegated Act, it would count as eligible for Taxonomy-eligibility disclosure. On the contrary, if an activity is not yet included in the Delegated Act, it should not be considered as being eligible. Furthermore, the Taxonomy is a dynamic framework that should expand its scope of activities overtime, in particular by including other environmental objectives, which should expand the scope of eligible activities accordingly.

In practical terms, identifying Taxonomy-eligible economic activities is the first step towards assessing the alignment of economic activities with the Taxonomy technical screening criteria. Eligible activities constitute the baseline universe of activities that have the potential to align with the technical screening criteria, including as transitional or enabling activities. 

As a general principle, eligibility reporting, in accordance with Article 10 of the Disclosures Delegated Act, should serve to help undertakings prepare for their future alignment disclosures(6)For the sake of clarity, it is noted that eligible activities do not equal to the denominator of the taxonomy alignment KPI. For non-financial undertakings total CapEx, OpEx and turnover will be used. Covered assets for the KPI of financial undertakings..

Finally, the Taxonomy Regulation, the Climate Delegated Act and the Disclosures Delegated Act do not differentiate between _core and non-core_ economic or business activities. Therefore, undertakings should report all of their economic activities in line with the definition of eligibility under Article 1(5) of the Disclosures Delegated Act, as explained above. 

The timeline for eligibility and alignment disclosures is further described in the FAQs Question 2, [published on 20 December 2021](https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/default/files/business_economy_euro/banking_and_finance/documents/sustainable-finance-taxonomy-article-8-report-eligible-activities-assets-faq_en.pdf).

### What are 'enabling' and ´transitional´ economic activities in the context of Taxonomy eligibility reporting?

Articles 16 and 10(2) of the Taxonomy Regulation define enabling and transitional economic activities.(7)Please refer to Articles 10(2) and 16 of the [Taxonomy Regulation EU 2020/852](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32020R0852&from=EN). Transitional activities are those for which low-carbon alternatives are not yet available and that have greenhouse gas emission levels that correspond to the best performance in the sector or industry, which fulfil the two following conditions: (i) they should not hamper the development and deployment of low-carbon alternatives and (ii) they should not lead to a lock-in of carbon-intensive assets, considering the economic lifetime of those assets. On the other hand, enabling activities are those that directly enable others to make a substantial contribution to an environmental objective. 

For eligibility reporting in accordance with Article 10 of the Disclosures Delegated Act, economic activities defined as enabling or transitional activities should not be treated differently from other activities. If they are within the scope of the respective description, they should be identified as eligible. 

It is noted however that an economic activity is only transitional or enabling under EU Taxonomy provided it meets the technical screening criteria in the respective section of Annex I and II to the Climate Delegated Act. Therefore, and in particular for the first year(s) of eligibility reporting in accordance with Article 10 of the Disclosures Delegated Act, those activities can only be considered as eligible-to be-transitional or eligible-to-be-enabling and reported i.e marked as such, on a voluntary basis. This is not different from eligibility reporting for other activities, where eligibility does not give an indication of the environmental performance of the activity. 

### How to identify and report eligibility for adaptation-related economic activities?

There are two different types of activities that can make a substantial contribution to climate change adaptation included in Annex II to the Climate Delegated Act:

  * adaptation activities, i.e. activities including adaptation solutions in accordance with Article 11 (1)(a) of the Taxonomy Regulation.(8)Article 11(1)(a) of the Taxonomy Regulation EU 2020/852 refers to activities. including adaptation solutions that either substantially reduce the risk of the adverse impact of the current climate and the expected future climate on that economic activity or substantially reduce that adverse impact, without increasing the risk of an adverse impact on people, nature or assets;
  * enabling economic activities, i.e. activities providing adaptation solutions in accordance with Article 11 (1)(b) of the Taxonomy Regulation.(9)Article 11 (1)(b) of the Taxonomy Regulation refers to activities thatprovide adaptation solutions that, in addition to satisfying the conditions set out in Article 16, contribute substantially to preventing or reducing the risk of the adverse impact of the current climate and the expected future climate on people, nature or assets, without increasing the risk of an adverse impact on other people, nature or assets..



Eligibility reporting requirements differ depending on whether the economic activity is marked as an enabling activity or an adaptation activity in Annex II to the Climate Delegated Act. For the former category (enabling activities), the turnover and corresponding CapEx and OpEx can qualify as eligible activities.(10)In accordance with recital 48 of the Climate Delegated Act ‘...However, when the core business of economic activities enabling adaptation in accordance with Article 11(1), point (b), of Regulation (EU) 2020/852 is to provide technologies, products, services, information, or practices with the objectives of increasing the level of resilience to physical climate risks of other people, nature, cultural heritage, assets or of other economic activities, in addition to capital expenditure, the turnover derived from products or services associated with those economic activities should be considered as proportion of turnover derived from products or services associated with economic activities that qualify as environmentally sustainable.’

For the latter category (adaptation activities), the reporting entity needs to demonstrate that a climate risk and vulnerability assessment has been performed and that an expenditure plan has been set up to implement adaptation solutions that reduce the activity’s most significant physical climate risks as set out in [Appendix A](./assets/documents/None Appendix A.pdf) to Annex II. Only if these requirements are fulfilled can the reporting entity count the CapEx and OpEx of the adaptation activity for Taxonomy eligibility. 

It is important to note here that the turnover derived from products and services associated with an adapted activity cannot be recognised for Taxonomy eligibility. This is because once the substantial contribution to climate change adaptation of an activity has taken place (i.e. once the activity has been made resilient to climate change), the turnover corresponding to that activity should not count as eligible. Note that the adapted activity may or may not provide environmental benefits.

### How should NACE codes be used to identify Taxonomy-eligible activities in the context of eligibility-reporting?

NACE is a classification system for products and economic activities. NACE codes provide a framework to collect and present a wide range of statistics in economic fields, based on economic activity. 

NACE uses four levels. The National transpositions of NACE codes sometimes include more than four levels, but the first four levels are the same for all Member States.

All descriptions of economic activities included in Annexes I and II to the Climate Delegated Act provide that the economic activities in the respective category can correspond to one or more specific NACE codes. 

Furthermore, recital 6 of the Climate Delegated Act clarifies that the references to NACE codes should be understood as indicative. The assessment of Taxonomy eligibility should be made in view of the specific description of the activity provided in the Annexes of the Climate Delegated Act.

More specifically, NACE codes should help users navigate through the Taxonomy, in particular those users that already work with NACE codes. NACE codes can help identify taxonomy-eligible activities (not aligned ones). However, only the specific activity description in the Climate Delegated Act sets out the exact scope of the activities included in the Act. 

In practice, this means that:

  * if a NACE code is broader than the activity description, the description prevails over the scope of the NACE code; 
  * if an economic activity does not have a NACE code but does meet the activity description, it can qualify as Taxonomy-eligible;
  * if an activity description does not fully correspond to the undertaking’s activity, it might be necessary to segment the undertaking’s activities so the respective parts can fall under the activity description or under several activities that are described separately;
  * if the NACE code of an economic activity is not mentioned in the Climate Delegated Act, but the economic activity corresponds to the description of the activity, it can qualify as Taxonomy eligible.



### Can undertakings report voluntary information in the context of Taxonomy eligibility reporting?

As a general rule, the Disclosures Delegated Act does not preclude voluntary disclosures of undertakings’ activities. On the contrary, all undertakings subject to the reporting obligation are encouraged to voluntarily report any relevant additional information where they consider that this is relevant to investors to gain a better understanding of the entity's taxonomy-eligibility. 

Nevertheless, and as a general principle for all undertakings, voluntary disclosures are not part of the mandatory disclosures under Article 8 of the Taxonomy Regulation and entities should always explain the reasons for making such disclosures.

Moreover, voluntary disclosures should not contradict or misrepresent mandatory information under the Disclosures Delegated Act. Voluntary disclosures should also not be more prominent than mandatory disclosures. If an undertaking includes a voluntary disclosure, it should add supporting detail setting out(11)See also question 12 of the [FAQs](https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/default/files/business_economy_euro/banking_and_finance/documents/sustainable-finance-taxonomy-article-8-report-eligible-activities-assets-faq_en.pdf) published on 20 December 2021.:

  * the basis for this disclosure;
  * the methods used for its preparation; and
  * a clear explanation of how it differs from mandatory reporting.



The [briefing](https://ec.europa.eu/info/business-economy-euro/banking-and-finance/sustainable-finance/overview-sustainable-finance/platform-sustainable-finance_en#activities)(12)Platform considerations on reporting voluntary information under Taxonomy-eligibility reporting. of the Platform on Sustainable Finance provides further advice on best practices for voluntary reporting and voluntary use of the templates for eligibility reporting in the first year(s) of reporting. 

### How far should undertakings assess and report Taxonomy eligible activities in their value chain, both upstream and downstream?

Generally, reporting on Taxonomy eligible activities does not entail an assessment of an undertaking’s value-chain, as _in most cases_ the descriptions of the activities in the Climate Delegated Act do not contain value-chain references. Likewise, companies are not expected to assess the sustainability of their suppliers in particular in the phase of eligibility reporting.

The Taxonomy sets criteria per sector and activity, not per product line or company. Companies that generate revenue in several sectors within the value chain of one product, must disclose the various processes and parts in the value chain across those sectors and activities. This applies to activities that are carried out by the reporting entity, not by its suppliers. Operators that are active in several sectors across the value chain of one product or technology, but generate revenue from that product only under one activity, must disclose only under that specific revenue-generating activity. 

For reporting turnover, assets and processes in the value chain of an activity are only eligible if they are explicitly included in the activity description. For example, if the description only refers to manufacturing of final products, intermediary activities in the value chain are not automatically eligible. Accordingly, manufacturing specific car and vehicle components is not automatically eligible under the section ‘manufacture of low carbon technologies for transport’”. From a supplier's perspective, this means that the activity of a company that is a supplier to a Taxonomy-eligible activity is not by definition Taxonomy-eligible and the manufacturing of specific components for cars is not by default eligible under the activity “manufacture of low carbon technologies for transport”. This is because the EU Taxonomy does not take a blanket approach for upstream activities. Instead it sets out specific criteria for each included activity, including the relevant ‘do no significant harm’ criteria.

However, certain key components that are spelled out in separate Sections, such as for batteries or hydrogen (in Sections 3.2 and 3.4) are eligible.  Furthermore, the manufacture of components can qualify under the section “manufacture of other low carbon technologies” (Section 3.6 of Annex I to the Climate Delegated Act) where not covered by other sections and where they meet the activity description. As the activity description in Section 3.6 is very broad, NACE codes C22, C25, C26, C27 and C28 should be considered as advice for the scope of this activity. The scope of NACE codes for this activity notably includes tyres and semi-conductors, if those products meet the activity description (see also question 19). Mining, by contrast, would not be covered by the description. 

For reporting CapEx and OpEx, all purchases of assets and processes or services that are essential to carry out a particular eligible activity are eligible as well. The components that car manufacturers purchase to manufacture low-carbon cars are eligible. Under eligibility reporting, the car- or vehicle manufacturers do not need to screen their suppliers and individual purchases. They must only determine whether their own manufacturing process is a Taxonomy-eligible economic activity. If the own activity is considered Taxonomy-eligible, the CapEx for investments in essential assets or components corresponding to that activity is considered Taxonomy-eligible. Another example is the purchase of software that is essential to develop or use ICT solutions for climate change mitigation, if these solutions are eligible under activity 8.2.

From a client’s perspective, the purchase of outputs of Taxonomy-eligible activities is not by definition Taxonomy-eligible. For example, the purchase of renewable energy does not by definition qualify as Taxonomy eligible(13)This may be reviewed overtime in light of the Fit for 55 package and climate goals agreed by the Council and the European Parliament.. The purchase of Taxonomy-eligible output is only eligible when it can be reported as one of the various types of CapEx or OpEx described in Annex I to the Disclosures Delegated Act, in particular such as for example the installation of solar panels on buildings covered by category (c) of CapEx mentioned in Section 1.1.2.2 of Annex I of to the Disclosures Delegated Act (see also Question 11). 

### How to identify Taxonomy-eligible activities of which activity descriptions contain qualifiers, such as ‘low carbon’, and ‘climate-related perils’?

The activity descriptions in the Climate Delegated Act serve as a reference point to identify Taxonomy-eligible activities. However, some descriptions contain “qualifiers” which could be understood in a subjective way, such as “low carbon”, which may in some cases impact the eligibility. 

Eligibility does not depend on compliance with the technical screening criteria but is assessed solely on the basis of the description of the activity. The qualifiers, such as “low carbon” vehicles or “low carbon” vessels for the purpose of Section 3.3 in the Annex I to the Climate Delegated Act (“manufacture of low carbon technologies for transport”), which are not defined in a clear way, should only be taken into account for the purposes of determining the compliance with the technical screening criteria and are therefore not relevant for the reporting on eligibility. For example, a car manufacturer would be able to report as eligible all their car manufacturing activities, including those of combustion engine cars.

On the other hand, in the case of the activity “manufacture of other low carbon technologies” (Section 3.6) the description of the activity points to the objective of the activity. The activity covers manufactured technologies that are “aimed at substantial life cycle greenhouse gas (GHG) emission savings in other sectors of the economy”. For any activity or product to be eligible for climate change mitigation under this category, the activity or product needs to have the objective of enabling a substantial reduction of GHG emissions in another sector of the economy. This means that if a technology is the best in their sector, but does not aim at substantial emission reductions in another sector, it would not be eligible. For example, a very energy efficient manufacturing process of a screw which does not aim to lead to emission reduction in another sector, would not qualify.

In a similar way, activity 10.1 in Annex II to the Climate Delegated Act (‘Non-life insurance: underwriting of climate-related perils’) refers to ‘climate related perils’. These are set out in [Appendix A](./assets/documents/None Appendix A.pdf) to Annex II to the Climate Delegated Act (‘Classification of climate-related hazards’). Insurance undertakings may only count a line of business as taxonomy eligible if it contains a policy with terms related to the treatment of climate perils.

### Should undertakings report a breakdown of Taxonomy eligibility per environmental objective?

Activities contributing to both climate change mitigation and climate change adaptation as defined in the Climate Delegated Act are within the scope of the first reporting year(s).

Article 10(2) and 10(3) of the Disclosures Delegated Act do not require the use of the reporting templates provided in the Annexes for eligibility reporting. They also do not explicitly require a distinction between environmental objectives for mitigation and adaptation in the first year(s) of eligibility reporting. 

However, advice is for undertakings to use on voluntary basis the templates included in the Annexes to the Disclosures Delegated Act that require a split of environmental objectives for alignment reporting. 

This suggestion is justified by the fact that when reporting their Taxonomy-alignment key performance indicators (KPIs) in accordance with the Disclosures Delegated Act, undertakings will be required to break down their economic activities based on their contributions across environmental objectives as specified in the tables of the Annexes to the Disclosures Delegated Act. This would make it easier to compare Taxonomy-eligibility reporting and Taxonomy-alignment reporting. It would also make reporting more consistent across undertakings’ first year(s) of eligibility reporting to prepare for their taxonomy-alignment reporting, on a voluntary basis. 

For activities covered, climate change mitigation and adaptation largely overlap in scope. However, for reporting the alignment KPIs, it should be noted that there are some important differences between the two Annexes to the Climate Delegated Act catering for specificities for each objective. These differences are set out in the bullet points below.

  * Certain activities are included only for climate change mitigation (Annex I) and not for climate change adaptation (Annex II), notably:
    * ‘Data-driven solutions for GHG emissions reductions’ (Section 8.2);
    * ‘Research, development and innovation for direct air capture of CO2’ (Section 9.2);and
    * ’Professional services related to energy performance of buildings’ (Section 9.3).
  * Certain activities are included only for climate change adaptation (Annex II) and not for climate change mitigation (Annex I), notably: 
    * ’Computer programming, consultancy and related activities’ (Section 8.2);
    * ’Programming and broadcasting activities’ (Section 8.3); and
    * ’Engineering activities and related technical consultancy dedicated to adaptation to climate change’ (Section 9.1). 
  * In addition, activities across the following sectors are only included for climate change adaptation: 
    * Insurance;
    * education;
    * human health;
    * social work; and
    * arts, entertainment, and recreation. 
  * Certain activities are included in both Annexes to the Climate Delegated Act but their names and descriptions differ. Notably, this concerns certain infrastructure for transport activities (Sections 6.15, 6.16 and 6.17) and certain manufacturing activities (such as Sections 3.2. and 3.4.). The names and descriptions of these activities were tailored to the specificities of the respective objective.
  * Lastly, some inconsistencies in the titles and descriptions of activities in Annexes I and Annex II have been signalled. For example, the words ‘light’ and ‘renting’ are missing in respectively the title and the description of activity 6.5. ‘Transport by motorbikes, passenger cars and commercial vehicles’ in Annex II. Any such inconsistencies should be signalled to the Commission for further correction. 



The [briefing](https://ec.europa.eu/info/business-economy-euro/banking-and-finance/sustainable-finance/overview-sustainable-finance/platform-sustainable-finance_en#activities)(14)Platform considerations on the reporting of voluntary information under Taxonomy-eligibility reporting. of the Platform on Sustainable Finance provides further advice on best practices for voluntary reporting for eligibility reporting in the first year(s) of reporting.

### How are turnover, CapEx and OpEx defined in the context of Taxonomy eligibility reporting?

The Disclosures Delegated Act sets out the definitions of Turnover, CapEx and OpEx key performance indicators (KPIs) in Sections 1.1.1, 1.1.2 and 1.1.3 of [Annex I](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32021R2178&from=EN) respectively.

Non-financial undertakings should disclose the part of their net turnover (as defined in Section 1.1.1. of Annex I to the Disclosures Delegated Act) that corresponds to their Taxonomy-eligible economic activities. 

As regards eligible CapEx information, in accordance with Section 1.1.3.2 of Annex I to the Disclosures Delegated Act, reporting focuses on the three categories of CapEx:

a) CapEx that is related to assets or processes corresponding to Taxonomy-eligible economic activities; 

b) CapEx that is part of a plan to expand Taxonomy-eligible economic activities or enable Taxonomy-eligible economic activities to become Taxonomy-aligned.

c) CapEx mentioned in category (c) of Section 1.1.2.2 of Annex I to the Disclosures Delegated Act, relating to the purchase of output from Taxonomy-eligible economic activities and individual measures enabling the target activities to become low-carbon or to lead to greenhouse gas reductions, notably activities listed in points 7.3 to 7.6 of Annex I to the Climate Delegated Act and other economic activities listed in the delegated acts adopted under Article 10(3), Article 11(3), Article 12(2), Article 13(2), Article 14(2) and Article 15(2) of the Taxonomy Regulation.

The measures corresponding to category (c) must be implemented and operational within 18 months.

For CapEx category c), the assessment focuses on the output and individual measures. It does not focus on the target economic activity for which the expenditure is incurred. Entities must assess whether the expenditure qualifies as:

  * a purchase of an output of a Taxonomy-eligible activity; or 
  * an individual measure to improve energy efficiency included in the Taxonomy. 



In other words such outputs and measures must be listed in the Climate Delegated Act. Expenditures on assets or processes which might be useful to enable the target activity to become low-carbon but which are not activities listed in the Climate Delegated Act do not fall under category (c). 

For a non-eligible target activity, for example a restaurant purchasing and installing solar panels, such expenditures could fall under category (c). For renovation of buildings, category (c) only covers measures corresponding to activities listed in the Climate Delegated Act (e.g. certain energy-efficient windows). 

The reporting of OpEx for the first year(s) of implementation of the Disclosures Delegated Act must follow the same approach. Reporting on the three categories mentioned in Section 1.1.3.2 should focus on the eligibility of the economic activities to which this expenditure correspond. Therefore, the three categories (a), (b) and (c) mentioned in Sections 1.1.2.2 and 1.1.3.2 relating to the numerator of CapEx and OpEx, respectively, are relevant for eligibility reporting in the first year(s) of implementation of the Disclosures Delegated Act. 

For example, regarding category (b), any CapEx on eligible activities made in 2021 (and reported in 2022 disclosures) would count as eligible in the 2022 report. This is regardless of whether the investment under the CapEx plan will meet the technical screening criteria set out in the Climate Delegated Act at maturity. 

Similarly, OpEx category (b) on eligible activities made in 2021 (and reported in 2022 disclosures) would count as eligible in the 2022 report. This is irrespective of whether the corresponding economic activity meets the technical screening criteria. This is because entities do not need to report on the alignment of their economic activities in the first year of reporting.

The [briefing](https://ec.europa.eu/info/business-economy-euro/banking-and-finance/sustainable-finance/overview-sustainable-finance/platform-sustainable-finance_en#activities)(15)Platform considerations on the reporting of voluntary information under Taxonomy-eligibility reporting. of the Platform on Sustainable Finance provides further advice on best practices for voluntary reporting for eligibility reporting in the first year(s) of reporting. 

### What is the scope of ‘other direct expenditures’ set out in Annex I to the Disclosures Delegated Act?

Section 1.1.3.1 (‘Denominator’) of Annex 1 to the Disclosures Delegated Act sets out that the denominator of the KPI for Taxonomy-aligned reporting ‘ _shall cover direct non-capitalised costs that relate to research and development, building renovation measures, short-term lease, maintenance and repair, and any other direct expenditures relating to the day-to-day servicing of assets of property, plant and equipment by the undertaking or third party to whom activities are outsourced that are necessary to ensure the continued and effective functioning of such assets.’_

The OpEx category in that sense is closely related to maintenance and repair costs which are already explicitly mentioned in the OpEx definition, in Section 1.1.3.1 of Annex I. 

In practice, this means the denominator of the OpEx KPI for Taxonomy-alignment reporting includes/excludes the costs set out in the table below. 

**Inclusions**

 **Exclusions (16)This list is non-exhaustive and provides examples of expenses that would not fit with the OpEx notion of “maintenance and repair, and any other direct expenditures relating to the day-to-day servicing of assets of property, plant and equipment by the undertaking or third party to whom activities are outsourced that are necessary to ensure the continued and effective functioning of such assets” per Section 1.1.3.1 of Annex I. As a general remark, expenses relating to overheads should be excluded to avoid as much as possible the subjectivity inherent in making allocations of those overheads to the specific item of property, plant and equipment concerned. **

### How should undertakings account for negative revenues in the context of Taxonomy-eligibility reporting?

The Disclosures Delegated Act does not specify how to treat negative revenues under Taxonomy eligibility reporting.

Negative revenue could be treated as a 0% value for Taxonomy-eligibility reporting. However, undertakings could, report the negative value in monetary amount. 

If the entity makes negative revenue within one activity, the denominator could be the absolute value of the positive turnover from the remaining activities. This could be used to calculate the proportion of eligible activities. Please see the example in Table 2.

### Should undertakings avoid double reporting of Taxonomy eligible activities?

Under Article 10 (2) of the Disclosures Delegated Act, undertakings must use Section 1.2 of Annex I to report Taxonomy-eligibility information as it relates to the reporting of qualitative information. Annex I, Section 1.2.2.1, point (c), explicitly states that undertakings should explain how they avoided double counting in the allocation of the amounts of Taxonomy-aligned turnover, CapEx and OpEx in the numerator of the relevant KPIs. The intention behind this requirement is to ensure reliability and consistency in reporting the three KPIs. 

It is suggested that under their Taxonomy-eligibility reporting, undertakings adopt a similar approach to that under Annex I, Section 1.2.2.1. Undertakings must explain how they have avoided double counting of the relevant amounts of turnover and expenditure across their reporting of eligible economic activities.

### Should an entity report Taxonomy-eligible turnover when the economic activity has not been performed by itself, but by a subcontractor?

Annex I, Section 1.1.1, clarifies that the reported turnover of Taxonomy-aligned activities must cover the revenue recognised under international accounting standard 1, paragraph 82(a), as adopted by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1126/2008(18)Commission Regulation (EC) No 1126/2008 of 3 November 2008 adopting certain international accounting standards in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 1606/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council, OJ L 320, 29.11.2008, p. 1..

For Taxonomy-eligibility reporting, in accordance with Article 10 of the Disclosures Delegated Act, entities reporting under the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) are encouraged to use the revenue accounted for in their financial statements in accordance with IFRS to disclose their turnover for the eligible activities. 

An entity should first determine the underlying economic activity in accordance with Annex I to the Climate Delegated Act to assess how it should report turnover from Taxonomy-eligible activities, although the goods or services have been provided by a subcontractor.  This is in line with the IFRS rules. Then, the entity should determine whether it controls the economic activity provided by a subcontractor. ´Control´ in this context means whether the entity controls the circumstances under which the subcontractor works. 

The [briefing](https://ec.europa.eu/info/business-economy-euro/banking-and-finance/sustainable-finance/overview-sustainable-finance/platform-sustainable-finance_en#activities)(19)Platform considerations on the reporting of voluntary information under Taxonomy-eligibility reporting. of the Platform on Sustainable Finance provides further advice on best practices for voluntary reporting for eligibility reporting in the first year(s) of reporting. 

### How should a non-financial undertaking report on products and services that are both consumed internally and sold externally?

Annex I to the Disclosures Delegated Act clarifies that undertakings must use the same accounting principles that apply to the preparation of their consolidated annual financial statements to calculate their Taxonomy-aligned turnover. This is to ensure comparability with the turnover reported in the entity's consolidated financial statements. As a result, when a consolidated non-financial statement is prepared, the accounting principles of consolidation would exclude intercompany sales and turnover from own consumption.

Section 1.2.3 of Annex I to the Disclosures Delegated Act provides that however non-financial undertakings ‘ _shall disclose information about the amounts related to Taxonomy-aligned activities pursued for non-financial undertakings’ own internal consumption’_

As a consequence, under Taxonomy-eligibility reporting, an entity should only include in its numerator the turnover from external sales. Turnover from ‘internal sales’ could be disclosed voluntarily, separately from the mandatory disclosure under the Disclosures Delegated Act.(20)Voluntary reporting should be prepared on a basis that does not contradict or misrepresent the mandatory information pursuant to the Disclosures Delegated Act and it should not be given more prominence than the mandatory disclosures. Where an undertaking includes voluntary reporting, this should be accompanied by supporting detail setting out the basis for this disclosure and methods used for its preparation along with a clear explanation on how it differs from mandatory reporting.

### How should non-financial undertakings treat intangibles under Taxonomy eligibility reporting?

The Disclosures Delegated Act refers to intangibles in the context of Taxonomy-alignment reporting in two sections: 

  1. Section 1.1.1 in relation to the turnover KPIs; and 
  2. Section 1.1.2.1 in relation to the denominator of the CapEx KPI. 



Therefore, CapEx reporting under Article 10 (2) of the Disclosures Delegated Act must include intangible assets that correspond to eligible economic activities as defined in Article 1(5) of the Disclosures Delegated Act.

The same approach should be followed for eligible turnover disclosures. This means that net turnover from intangible assets should be counted if it corresponds to eligible economic activities under the Disclosures Delegated Act.

Intangible assets are not included in the OpEx definition. However, the definition of the denominator of the OpEx KPI in Section 1.1.3.1, which refers to direct non-capitalised costs’. Therefore, intangibles that are not capitalised under international accounting standard 38 do not count as assets and are therefore allocated to OpEx.

### Should non-financial undertakings report the Taxonomy eligibility of their non-EU activities?

Non-financial undertakings that fall within scope of the NFRD must cover in their non-financial reporting their economic activities regardless of whether these take place outside the Union. The same approach applies to the reporting obligation under Article 8 of the Taxonomy Regulation and under the Disclosures Delegated Act.(22)For financial undertakings, Article 7 of the Disclosures Delegated Act clarifies that non-NFRD exposures (which include non-EU) shall not be reported in the numerator of the KPI, subject to a review to be carried out in accordance with Article 9 of the Disclosures Delegated Act.

Article 10 (2) of the Disclosures Delegated Act sets out the reporting obligations of non-financial undertakings for their first year of reporting. Non-financial undertakings must include the turnover, CapEx and OpEx related to non-EU eligible activities in their eligibility disclosures. 

Non-financial undertakings would also be expected to provide information on the assessment of economic activities carried out in non-EU countries in the narrative information required under Annex I, Section 1.2 ( _Specification of disclosures accompanying the KPIs of non-financial undertakings_ ). The information disclosed under this section would focus on the assessment of eligibility of economic activities.

### How should non-financial undertakings treat the turnover of eligible activities that are deconsolidated during the financial year?

Annex I, Section 1.1.1 clarifies that the reported turnover of Taxonomy-aligned activities must cover the revenue recognised under international accounting standard 1, paragraph 82(a), as adopted by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1126/2008.

For Taxonomy-eligibility reporting and in accordance with Article 10 of the Disclosures Delegated Act, entities reporting under the IFRS are encouraged to use the revenue accounted for in their financial statements under the IFRS to disclose their turnover for the eligible activities.

Under IFRS 10, paragraphs 25 and B98, if a parent undertaking loses control over a subsidiary, it must continue to recognise any income and expenses arising from that subsidiary and incurred up to the date of deconsolidation (i.e. where a subsidiary no longer forms part of a parent undertaking/group) in its income statement. However, all related assets and liabilities must be derecognised from the statement of financial position upon deconsolidation.

For example, a subsidiary is sold on 30 June and up to that date it has generated Taxonomy‑eligible turnover. Therefore, on 31 December, the parent undertaking reporting under IFRS will no longer consolidate the assets and liabilities of that subsidiary due to the loss of control that occurred on 30 June. H, it will still account in its income statement for the Taxonomy-eligible turnover arising from the former subsidiary up until June 30. For reporting under the Disclosures Delegated Act, this means that Taxonomy‑eligible sales must also be recognised up to 30 June.

### What should financial undertakings report if underlying entities’ information is not publicly available?

Undertakings falling under the NFRD must report their Taxonomy eligibility in their non-financial statement alongside their annual accounts. Different undertakings report their annual accounts at different points throughout the fiscal year. Therefore, financial undertakings may not have all the information publicly available to enable their own eligibility disclosures in the first reporting cycle (in 2022).(23)For further detail on reporting obligations, please see Question 4 (‘How should mixed groups composed of financial and non-financial undertakings, or with diversified and multiple lines of activities report?’) of the published [FAQs](https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/default/files/business_economy_euro/banking_and_finance/documents/sustainable-finance-taxonomy-article-8-report-eligible-activities-assets-faq_en.pdf).

Article 10(3) of the Disclosures Delegated Act does not exclude application of Article 8(4) of the Disclosures Delegated Act. Under this Article, financial undertakings must use the most recently available information provided by the financial or non-financial underlying investee entity or counterparty for their eligibility reporting. This aids consistency between Taxonomy-eligibility reporting and Taxonomy-alignment reporting, and across undertakings.

If information is not readily or publicly available, financial undertakings are encouraged to contact their underlying entities that fall under the scope of the NFRD. These could use either voluntary disclosures or bilateral exchanges with their underlying investees or counterparties to provide Taxonomy‑related information.

In addition, financial undertakings could choose to estimate their eligibility disclosures and report the information voluntarily, separately from their mandatory disclosures under the Disclosures Delegated Act.(24)Voluntary reporting should not contradict or misrepresent mandatory information under the Disclosures Delegated Act. It should also not be more prominent than mandatory disclosures. If an undertaking includes voluntary reporting, it should add supporting detail to it setting out the basis for this disclosure, the methods used for its preparation, and a clear explanation of how it differs from mandatory reporting.

### What is the difference between covered assets and total assets in the context of Taxonomy eligibility reporting?

The Annexes to the Disclosures Delegated Act set out the scope of the KPIs for Taxonomy-alignment reporting.

For instance, Annex V, Section 1.1 (‘Scope of the KPIs’), sets out that, for credit institutions, covered assets are the total on-balance sheet assets minus those assets that are excluded from the calculation of the green asset ratio. This means that covered assets are all assets in the balance-sheet or portfolio of an asset manager, excluding exposures to central banks, supranational issuers and central governments, as set out in Article 7(1) of the Disclosures Delegated Act. For credit institutions, assets held for trading as defined in [Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2021/451](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32021R0451&from=EN)(26)Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2021/451 of 17 December 2020 laying down implementing technical standards for the application of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council with regard to supervisory reporting of institutions and repealing Implementing Regulation (EU) No 680/2014, OJ L 97, 19.3.2021, p. 1. (FINREP)) also do not fall under the KPIs. 

In line with the exclusions under Article 10(3) (b) and (c), financial undertakings should use a scope of covered assets for their eligibility reporting disclosures that is similar to the scope of covered assets for their alignment reporting. This would make it easier to compare Taxonomy-eligibility reporting and Taxonomy-alignment reporting.

This means that the financial undertaking should clearly indicate:

  * the assets that are excluded from the denominator of the Taxonomy-eligible assets ratio (e.g. exposures to central governments, central banks and supranational issuers; the trading portfolio of credit institutions); and 
  * the percentage of covered assets that are Taxonomy-eligible over total assets.



### Should cash and cash equivalent assets be considered in the context of Taxonomy eligibility reporting?

Article 10(3) should be read in conjunction with Article 7 (1), (2) and (3) of the Disclosures Delegated Act. Cash and cash equivalent assets are not excluded from the exposures referred to in Article 7 (1), (2) and (3).

Under the Disclosures Delegated Act and its Annex I, these exposures are included in the denominator of the Taxonomy-aligned KPIs of financial institutions. However, it does not seem feasible to assess the eligibility of cash and cash equivalent assets as they are not actually funding an economic activity. It is also not clear which economic activity these assets will be allocated. These assets can only be reported as funding eligible activities once the funds have been allocated to a specific activity.

### How may asset managers weight their holdings in a portfolio to report Taxonomy-eligible assets?

Article 10(3) of the Disclosures Delegated Act do not require the use of the reporting templates provided in the Annexes for eligibility reporting. However, advice is for undertakings to voluntarily use the templates provided in the Annexes to the Disclosures Delegated Act to prepare their Taxonomy-eligibility reporting.

In this regard, Annex III to the Disclosures Delegated Act, sets out the details of the numerator and denominator of asset managers’ for their Taxonomy-aligned KPIs. 

In accordance with Annex III Section 1 (‘ _Content of KPI to be disclosed by asset managers’_ ), eligibility reporting is not weighted by the stake in the undertaking’s equity, debt or enterprise value including cash. It is weighted by the value of the exposures in the total assets of the asset manager (see the definition of the numerator in Annex III, Section 1.1).

For example, where an asset manager is exposed to two assets:

  * EUR 100m equity in 100% eligible company A;
  * EUR 100m bond in 0% eligible company B.



= EUR 200m total assets.

This means: 50% eligibility over total assets = (100*100% + 100*0%)/200.

The [briefing](https://ec.europa.eu/info/business-economy-euro/banking-and-finance/sustainable-finance/overview-sustainable-finance/platform-sustainable-finance_en#activities)(27)Platform considerations on the reporting of voluntary information under Taxonomy-eligibility reporting. of the Platform on Sustainable Finance provides further advice on best practices for voluntary reporting for eligibility reporting in the first year(s) of reporting. 

### Do mortgages qualify as eligible for an asset manager (as an investment) or only for the bank that provided the loan originally?

Article 10(3) should be read in conjunction with Article 7 (1), (2) and (3) of the Disclosures Delegated Act. Mortgages are not excluded from the exposures referred to in Article 7(1), (2) and (3). Therefore, mortgages should qualify as eligible assets for both asset managers and credit institutions.

### What activities should an insurer and a reinsurer consider when reporting their underwriting activities in the context of Taxonomy eligibility reporting?

The Climate Delegated Act sets out the activities covered by the underwriting. These activities relate to non-life insurance and reinsurance activities consisting in underwriting of climate-related perils. 

Eligible non-life insurance activities are specified in, Section 10.1, sub-section ‘Description of the activity’, points (a) to (h) of Annex II to the Climate Delegated Act. As indicated in the name of the activity, apart from belonging to a relevant line of business, the insurance policy terms must provide coverage of risks related to 'climate perils' in view of [Appendix A](./assets/documents/None Appendix A.pdf) to Annex II to the Climate Delegated Act in order to be counted for Taxonomy-eligibility. 

The reinsurance of eligible insurance activities can also be counted for Taxonomy-eligibility.

### Do the reporting obligations under the Disclosures Delegated Act apply to a large entity that is not a credit institution under Article 4 of the Capital Requirements Regulation but is treated as a financial undertaking under Articles 19a and 29a of the NFRD?

This situation can arise if specialised financial undertakings (e.g. factoring or guarantee businesses) that are not credit institutions under Article 4 of Regulation EU 575/2013(28)Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 June 2013 on prudential requirements for credit institutions and investment firms and amending Regulation (EU) No 648/2012, OJ L 176, 27.6.2013, p. 1. (the Capital Requirements Regulation (CRR)) are treated as such under national law. If an entity does not meet the definition of a credit institution set out in Article 4 of the CRR, normally it does not fall under in scope of the Disclosures Delegated Act. 

If, on the other hand, the same entity is deemed a large public-interest undertaking with more than 500 employees, it falls under the NFRD and thus the Disclosures Delegated Act. Then it is also subject to the Taxonomy Regulation and the related disclosure obligations. Furthermore, such firms are encouraged to disclose voluntarily under Annex VI if they consider this Annex to be more relevant and also if they are submitting supervisory reporting in accordance with ([Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2021/451](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32021R0451&from=EN)(29)Regulation (EU) 2021/451 of 17 December 2020 laying down implementing technical standards for the application of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council with regard to supervisory reporting of institutions and repealing Implementing Regulation (EU) No 680/2014, OJ L 97, 19.3.2021, p. 1. ([FINREP](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32021R0451&from=EN))) to their National Competent Authority (NCA).

### How can CapEx be associated with general purpose lending in the context of Taxonomy eligibility reporting?

Article 10(2) and 10(3) of the Disclosures Delegated Act do not require the use of the reporting templates provided in the Annexes for eligibility reporting. However, advice is for undertakings to voluntarily use the templates provided in the Annexes to the Disclosures Delegated Act to prepare their Taxonomy-eligibility reporting. 

In this regard, Annex V to the Disclosures Delegated Act, sets out the details of how credit institutions must report their Taxonomy-alignment KPIs:

If the use of proceeds is unknown i) loans and advances – general purpose, (ii) debt securities - general purpose, and (iii) equity holdings, all of which are recorded in the banking book), Taxonomy aligned/eligibility exposures should be calculated twice. They are the sum of the gross carrying amount of the total loans and advances, debt securities, and equity holdings, with unknown use of proceeds to non-financial undertakings. The sum must be weighted by the proportion of Taxonomy-aligned/eligible economic activities of the counterparty calculated based on:

  * the turnover KPI of the counterparty (share of the turnover that is Taxonomy aligned); and 
  * the CapEx KPI of the counterparty (share of the CapEx that is Taxonomy aligned).



Therefore, to report Taxonomy-alignment KPIs, credit institutions must assign the published CapEx KPI of the underlying company to the relevant general purpose loan, debt security, or equity holding in the same manner as the turnover KPI(30)This approach is aligned with the reporting rules set out in the Non-Financial Reporting Directive (NFRD). If there is no information on the issuer, the entity may use disclosures of the parent entity if it falls under the NFRD..

For eligibility-reporting, credit institutions could disclose the proportion of their eligible general-purpose assets based on:

  * the underlying entity’s reported eligible turnover;
  * and on the underlying entity’s reported eligible CapEx.

### How should a credit institution with a Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MifiD) investment firm license report its Taxonomy-eligible economic activities?

If a parent undertaking is classified as a credit institution (under the CRR), but undertakes investment activities, it should follow the requirements for credit institutions under the Disclosures Delegated Act.

Article 10(2) and 10(3) of the Disclosures Delegated Act do not require the use of the reporting templates provided in the Annexes for eligibility reporting. However, advice is for undertakings to voluntarily use the templates provided in the Annexes of the Disclosures Delegated Act to prepare their Taxonomy-eligibility reporting. 

In this regard, Annex VI to the Disclosures Delegated Act, sets out the templates that credit institutions must use to report their Taxonomy-alignment key KPIs for investment activities. Therefore, for eligibility-reporting, credit institutions could disclose, on a voluntary basis, the proportion of their eligible investment activities.

The [briefing](https://ec.europa.eu/info/business-economy-euro/banking-and-finance/sustainable-finance/overview-sustainable-finance/platform-sustainable-finance_en#activities)(32)Platform considerations on the reporting of voluntary information under Taxonomy-eligibility reporting. of the Platform on Sustainable Finance provides further advice on best practices for voluntary reporting for eligibility reporting and use of the reporting templates in the first year(s) of reporting. 

### How to assess and report the Taxonomy eligibility of a debt asset such as a bond or a loan?

Article 10(2) and (3) of the Disclosures Delegated Act do not require the use of the reporting templates provided in the Annexes for eligibility reporting. However, advice is for undertakings to voluntarily use the templates provided in the Annexes of the Disclosures Delegated Act to prepare their Taxonomy-eligibility reporting. 

In this regard, Annex V to the Disclosures Delegated Act, sets out the details of how to assess and report loans and debt instruments for Taxonomy-alignment KPIs. Annex V explains that general purpose lending or debt carries the Taxonomy-eligibility turnover or CapEx value of the underlying entity (i.e. investee or counterparty). 

To calculate Taxonomy-eligibility of general-purpose debt instruments, it is recommended to apply the eligibility value of the underlying entity (turnover and CapEx). 

If all or a portion of the use of proceeds of a debt instrument is Taxonomy-eligible, reporting of this value would take precedence over the issuer-level value within the Taxonomy-alignment KPIs. Such proceeds may be directly allocated to Taxonomy-eligible activities or be part of a CapEx or OpEx plan to render an activity or asset Taxonomy-aligned.

For Taxonomy-eligibility reporting, it could be considered, for example, that if 50% of the proceeds of the debt instrument are allocated to Taxonomy-eligible projects or programmes, the Taxonomy-eligibility Turnover and CapEx values of the bond should be 50%. 

In this sense, not all of a use of proceeds (green) debt instrument would be eligible under the Taxonomy in its entirety. However, it would be eligible for the portion of the proceeds that can be allocated to Taxonomy-eligible activities.

The [briefing](https://ec.europa.eu/info/business-economy-euro/banking-and-finance/sustainable-finance/overview-sustainable-finance/platform-sustainable-finance_en#activities)(33)Platform considerations on the reporting of voluntary information under Taxonomy-eligibility reporting. of the Platform on Sustainable Finance provides further advice on best practices for voluntary reporting for eligibility reporting in the first year(s) of reporting. 

### Does the use of all proceeds from debt products need to be independently verified if reported as Taxonomy-eligible?

There is no requirement that proceeds from debt products be independently verified as Taxonomy‑eligible. This answer has no bearing on specific requirements for external review or external assurance under Union legislation.

### Can green debt instruments from non-EU entities be reported as Taxonomy eligible?

Article 10(3) of the Disclosures Delegated Act clarifies that financial undertakings should disclose information taking into consideration the provisions under Article 7(3) of the Disclosures Delegated Act.

In accordance with Article 7(3) of the Disclosures Delegated Act, undertakings which do not fall under the NFRD (including non-EU undertakings) are excluded from the numerator but included in the denominator of the KPIs for Taxonomy-alignment reporting of financial undertakings. This treatment will be reviewed by 30 June 2024.

However, Article 7(4) states: ‘ _Without prejudice to paragraph 1, environmentally sustainable bonds or debt securities with the purpose of financing specific identified activities that are issued by an investee undertaking shall be included in the numerator of KPIs up to the full value of Taxonomy-aligned economic activities that the proceeds of those bonds and debt securities finance, on the basis of information provided by the investee undertaking_.’

Therefore, financial undertakings shall include in the numerator of the eligibility disclosure the Taxonomy-eligible proceeds of environmentally sustainable bonds and debt securities whose purpose is to finance specific identified activities.

Debt securities under Article 7(4) include non-EU issuers’ use of proceeds bonds, and do not include use of proceed loans, in line with the definitions set out in the Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2021/451 (FINREP).(34)See Annex V to Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2021/451 and Art 1 2(a) of Commission Recommendation of 6 May 2003 concerning the definition of micro, small and medium-sized enterprises, OJ L 124, 20.5.2003, p. 36.

As a general remark, the scope of this exclusion from the numerator of the KPI will be reviewed in 2024 in accordance with Article 9 of the Disclosures Delegated Act. 

In addition, the Disclosures Delegated Act does not prevent financial undertakings from including voluntary information about their exposures to non-EU entities’ investments with use of proceeds that is deemed to be eligible. Such information must always be reported separately from mandatory disclosures under the Disclosures Delegated Act.(35)Voluntary reporting should not contradict or misrepresent mandatory information under the Disclosures Delegated Act. It should also not be more prominent than mandatory disclosures. If an undertaking includes voluntary reporting, it should add supporting detail to it setting out the basis for this disclosure, the methods used for its preparation, and a clear explanation of how it differs from mandatory reporting.

### Can green sovereign debt be reported as Taxonomy eligible?

Article 10(3) of the Disclosures Delegated Act clarifies that financial undertakings should disclose information taking into consideration the provisions set out in Article 7(1) of the Disclosures Delegated Act.

Article 7(1) excludes exposures to central governments, central banks and supranational issuers from the calculation of the numerator and denominator of KPIs of financial undertakings. Therefore, in accordance with Article 10 of the Disclosures Delegated Act, financial undertakings should not include their sovereign exposures in their Taxonomy-eligible disclosures. 

The [briefing](https://ec.europa.eu/info/business-economy-euro/banking-and-finance/sustainable-finance/overview-sustainable-finance/platform-sustainable-finance_en#activities)(37)Platform considerations on the reporting of voluntary information under Taxonomy-eligibility reporting. of the Platform on Sustainable Finance provides further advice on best practices for voluntary reporting for eligibility reporting in the first year(s) of reporting. 

### How does the Disclosures Delegated Act interact with the proposed requirements on corporate sustainability reporting?

The proposed corporate sustainability reporting directive (CSRD), amending the existing reporting requirements introduced in the Accounting Directive by the NFRD should complement the Disclosures Delegated Act, which has the same mandatory scope of application as the rules on sustainability reporting in the Accounting Directive.(38)The proposed corporate sustainability reporting directive (CSRD) is expected to amend the provisions of the Accounting Directive introduced by the Non-Financial Reporting Directive, subject to the outcome of the process of negotiations of the proposal. See proposal for a Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Directive 2013/34/EU, Directive 2004/109/EC, Directive 2006/43/EC and Regulation (EU) No 537/2014, as regards corporate sustainability reporting, COM/2021/189 final. The proposed CSRD will extend the personal scope of the current reporting requirements to cover:

  * all large listed and non-listed companies; and 
  * all listed SMEs, except micro companies. 



In addition to the Taxonomy related reporting requirements currently detailed in the Taxonomy Delegated Act, these companies will need to publish sustainability information in their management reports, in accordance with sustainability reporting standards which the Commission will adopt via delegated acts.

According to the CSRD proposal, companies concerned would need to disclose sustainability information under the new requirements for the first time in 2024, for the financial year 2023. Under the proposal, listed SMEs would benefit from a transition period of 3 years and would be required to disclose the information for the first time in 2027 for the financial year 2026. 

In principle and depending on the outcome of the legislative process on the CSRD, reporting requirements under each regulation will be clearly defined and should also be streamlined and coherent to the extent possible so that companies should not report the same information twice. 

The information under the Disclosures Delegated Act should be reported in the same management report at company level, alongside other sustainability related information required under the CSRD provisions as proposed. To this information, the same assurance and digitalisation requirements would apply as to the rest of the sustainability information reported. 

## Taxonomy-Eligibility reporting (part 1)

### What is the Disclosures Delegated Act of the Taxonomy Regulation Article 8?

On 6 July 2021, the European Commission adopted the Delegated Act supplementing Article 8 of the Taxonomy Regulation (“the [Disclosures Delegated Act](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32021R2178&from=EN)”), which requires large financial and non-financial companies to provide information to investors about the environmental performance of their assets and economic activities. The Delegated Act is published in the [Official Journal](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32021R2178&from=EN) and becomes applicable on 1 January 2022.

The overall objective of the Disclosures Delegated Act is to increase transparency in the market. It will help financial market participants to design financial products and portfolios on the basis of disclosures from financial and non-financial undertakings.

The Disclosures Delegated Act specifies the disclosure obligations under Article 8 of the [Taxonomy Regulation (EU) 2020/852](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:32020R0852)(2)Regulation (EU) 2020/852 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 June 2020 on the establishment of a framework to facilitate sustainable investment, and amending Regulation (EU) 2019/2088, OJ L 198, 22.6.2020, p. 13.. The Delegated Act specifies the content, methodology and presentation of information to be disclosed by large financial and non-financial undertakings on the share of their business, investments or lending activities that are aligned with the Taxonomy Regulation. 

Non-financial undertakings are in particular required according to Article 8(2) Taxonomy Regulation to disclose the share of their turnover, capital and operational expenditure associated with environmentally sustainable economic activities as defined in the Taxonomy Regulation and the [EU Taxonomy Climate Delegated Act (EU) 2021/2139](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=OJ:L:2021:442:FULL&from=EN)(3)Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2021/2139 of 4 June 2021 supplementing Regulation (EU) 2020/852 of the European Parliament and of the Council by establishing the technical screening criteria for determining the conditions under which an economic activity qualifies as contributing substantially to climate change mitigation or climate change adaptation and for determining whether that economic activity causes no significant harm to any of the other environmental objectives, OJ L 442, 9.12.2021, p. 1., as well as any future delegated acts on other environmental objectives. In the case of financial undertakings (investment firms, asset managers, insurers, credit institutions), key performance indicators (KPIs) relate to the proportion of environmentally sustainable economic activities in their financing activities, such as lending, investment and insurance.(4)Article 8(2) of the Taxonomy Regulation specifies the key performance indicators (KPIs) related to turnover, capital expenditure and operational expenditure that non-financial undertakings must disclose, but it does not specify equivalent indicators for financial undertakings, mainly large banks, asset managers, investment firms, insurance and reinsurance undertakings.

### What should financial and non-financial undertakings report and by when?

The timeline for the application of reporting requirements is provided in Article 10 of the Disclosures Delegated Act, which is as follows:  

As of January 2022, in accordance with Article 10(2) and (3), all large undertakings will need to report the proportion of their activities (or the proportion of their exposures to activities) that are considered as eligible in accordance with Article 1(5) and non-eligible in accordance with Article 1(6) of the Disclosures Delegated Act in their turnover, capital (‘CapEx’) and operational expenditure (‘OpEx’) and total assets (in the case of financial undertakings).(5)Information shall be reported alongside the undertaking’s non-financial or consolidated non-financial statements in accordance with Article 19a or Article 29a Accounting Directive 2013/34/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 June 2013 on the annual financial statements, consolidated financial statements and related reports of certain types of undertakings, amending Directive 2006/43/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council and repealing Council Directives 78/660/EEC and 83/349/EEC, OJ L 182, 29.6.2013, p. 19–76, last amended by Directive (EU) 2021/2101 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 November 2021 amending Directive 2013/34/EU as regards disclosure of income tax information by certain undertakings and branches, OJ L 429, 1.12.2021, p. 1. Furthermore, financial undertakings (according to in Annex XI) and non-financial undertakings (according to Section 1.2 of Annex I) have to disclose qualitative information as of January 2022. In 2022, large entities are not required to assess the Taxonomy-alignment of these activities. They are also only required to report against activities contributing to climate objectives according to the [EU Climate Delegated Act](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=OJ:L:2021:442:FULL&from=EN). 

As a general principle, eligibility reporting in the first year(s) of reporting, as per Article 10 of the Disclosures Delegated Act, should serve to help undertakings prepare for their alignment disclosures. 

To facilitate coherence in reporting between Taxonomy-eligibility and alignment reporting and to ensure coherence of the reporting across undertakings, it is suggested that financial undertaking-related disclosures should be based on actual information provided by the financial or non-financial underlying investee entity or counterparty, in accordance with Article 8(4) second subparagraph of the Disclosures Delegated Act.

In 2023, in accordance with Article 10(4) of the Disclosures Delegated Act, large non-financial undertakings will need to report the activities that are considered as aligned with the EU [Climate Delegated Act](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=OJ:L:2021:442:FULL&from=EN).

1: What undertakings should report and by when

* Article 8 (2) and (3) Disclosures Delegated Act stipulates that information disclosed in accordance with this Regulation shall cover the annual reporting period from the previous calendar year of the date of disclosure and that financial undertakings and non-financial undertakings shall provide in the non-financial statement the key performance indicators covering the previous annual reporting period. Therefore, the first reporting period concerns the (fiscal) year of 2021. 

For undertakings where the fiscal year is congruent with the calendar year the first reporting period is therefore the 1st of January 2021 to the 31st of December 2021. In the case an undertaking has a diverging fiscal year, only the last annual reporting period has to be covered. For instance if an undertaking has a fiscal year starting on the 1st of July and ending on the 30th of June it would mean that the first disclosures according to Article 8 Taxonomy Regulation would (only) have to cover the period 1st of July 2021 to 30th of June 2022 as this would be the previous annual reporting period. 

### To what extent can accounting principles be applied in order to complement descriptions of economic activities from the Climate Delegated Act?

Article 1(5) of the Disclosures Delegated Act defines an eligible economic activity as an activity that is described in the delegated acts adopted pursuant to the Taxonomy Regulation.(6)Article 10(3), Article 11(3), Article 12(2), Article 13(2), Article 14(2), and Article 15(2) Taxonomy Regulation, which correspond to the Climate Delegated Act for the reporting period 2022.

The assessment of eligibility of economic activities is not dependent on the accounting standards used. 

However, and for example, the turnover key performance indicator (KPI), to be disclosed pursuant to Article 8 of the Taxonomy Regulation, should be calculated based on the same accounting principles that apply to the preparation of the undertaking's financial statements, as defined in the Annex I to the Disclosures Delegated Act. The assessment of the eligibility of economic activities whose turnover is reflected in the financial statements depends on the requirements included in the Climate Delegated Act and Disclosures Delegated Act Article 1(5) described above.

### How should mixed groups composed of financial and non-financial undertakings, or with diversified and multiple lines of activities report?

Undertakings that have to prepare a non-financial statement in accordance with Chapter 6 of the Article 19a of the [Accounting Directive (2013/34/EU)](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32013L0034&from=EN), or where applicable, a consolidated non-financial statement according to Article 29a of that Directive, should comply with the disclosure requirements of Article 8 of the Taxonomy Regulation. In the case of the latter, the information should be disclosed on a consolidated basis. 

In the case of credit institutions, the information should be disclosed in accordance with the requirements relating to prudential consolidation laid down in Part One, Title II, Chapter 2 of the [Capital Requirements Regulation (EU) 575/2013](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32013L0036&from=EN). 

Consolidated non-financial statement disclosures should be based on the same consolidation principles that apply to the group’s financial reporting under the applicable accounting principles, in order to ensure comparability of this reporting with the group's financial information. In addition, the exemption to subsidiary undertakings - when the parent undertaking is reporting at group level according to Article 29a of the Accounting Directive - also applies to disclosures under Article 8 of the Taxonomy Regulation. Therefore, if the parent of a group is a financial company, then the consolidated reporting shall be made as a financial undertaking. The consolidated financial statements could include segmental reporting, which can be mirrored in the consolidated non-financial statement.

Entities are free to provide additional voluntary disclosures where they consider that this is relevant to investors to gain a better understanding of the entity's taxonomy-eligibility for the first year of reporting and taxonomy-alignment thereafter. Nevertheless, and as a general principle for all undertakings, voluntary disclosures are not part of the mandatory disclosures under Article 8 of the Taxonomy Regulation and entities should always explain the reasons for making such disclosures.

### Should financial and non-financial undertakings use the Annexes provided in the Disclosure Delegated Act to report their eligibility disclosures?

Article 10(2) and 10(3) of the Disclosures Delegated Act do not require the use of the reporting templates for the reporting of eligibility information, except for the reporting of qualitative information. 

However, to facilitate comparability in reporting between Taxonomy-eligibility and alignment reporting and also to ensure coherence of the reporting across undertakings, it is suggested that financial and non-financial undertakings use on voluntary basis the templates included in the Annexes to the Disclosures Delegated Act. This should be done to the extent possible, to guide eligibility-related disclosures in their first year(s) of eligibility-reporting (in 2022 for non-financial undertakings, in 2022 and 2023 for financial undertakings).

For example, non-financial undertakings could fill in columns 2 to 4 in the following rows of Annex II 

_a_ ) Total (A.1 + A.2) in order to provide eligibility-related disclosures for eligible economic activities, 

_b_ ) Turnover of Taxonomy non-eligible activities (B); and 

_c_ ) Total (A+B). This information could be provided as regards the turnover, CapEx and OpEx.

Further guidance on voluntary reporting and voluntary use of the templates for eligibility reporting in the first year(s) of reporting is provided by the Platform on Sustainable Finance in its [Appendix](https://ec.europa.eu/info/files/sustainable-finance-taxonomy-eligibility-reporting-voluntary-information_en).(7)[Platform considerations on the reporting of voluntary information as part of Taxonomy-eligibility reporting.](https://ec.europa.eu/info/files/sustainable-finance-taxonomy-eligibility-reporting-voluntary-information_en)

### What should undertakings with no Taxonomy-eligible economic activities report?

Article 1(6) of the Disclosures Delegated Act clarifies that ‘ _taxonomy-non-eligible economic activity’ means any economic activity that is not described in the delegated acts adopted pursuant to Article 10(3), Article 11(3), Article 12(2), Article 13(2), Article 14(2) and Article 15(2), of Regulation (EU) 2020/852’._

In accordance with Article 10 of the Disclosures Delegated Act, undertakings are required to disclose the proportion of Taxonomy-eligible and Taxonomy-non-eligible economic activities in their turnover, CapEx and OpEx.

Undertakings that do not have eligible economic activities as defined in Article 1(5) of the Disclosures Delegated Act should therefore disclose the information that is required in relation to their non-eligible economic activities.

For instance, a non-financial undertaking whose economic activities are non-eligible could nonetheless fill in Section B of the templates provided in Annex II to the Disclosures Delegated Act, as this part relates to information on economic activities that are non-eligible.

### Should Taxonomy-eligibility reporting as part of the Disclosures Delegated Act be externally assured?

Article 8(1) of the Taxonomy Regulation clarifies that ‘ _any undertaking which is subject to an obligation to publish non-financial information pursuant to Article 19a or Article 29a of Directive 2013/34/EU shall include in its non-financial statement or consolidated non-financial statement information on how and to what extent the undertaking’s activities are associated with economic activities that qualify as environmentally sustainable […].’_

The non-financial statements as introduced by the [Non-Financial Reporting Directive (NFRD) (EU) 2014/95](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32014L0095&from=EN) are subject to an existence check by the statutory auditor in accordance with the Accounting Directive 2013/34/EU. There is no requirement in Union Law to verify the content of the disclosures.

The proposed Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD)(8)For further reference see Proposal for a Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Directive 2013/34/EU, Directive 2004/109/EC, Directive 2006/43/EC and Regulation (EU) No 537/2014, as regards corporate sustainability reporting, [COM/2021/189 final](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52021PC0189). is expected to amend the provisions governing non-financial reporting introduced by the NFRD, subject to the outcome of the process of negotiations of the proposal. The CSRD in this regard would require auditors to verify and express an opinion on sustainability reporting’s compliance with the requirements (including reporting according to the Taxonomy Regulation and its delegated acts). Member States would have the possibility to allow independent assurance services providers other than auditors to carry out the assurance engagement. 

### Should non-financial undertakings provide the three ratios in the context of Taxonomy-eligibility reporting (Turnover, CapEx, OpEx)?

Article 10(2) of the Disclosures Delegated Act explicitly requires that in the first year of implementation, non-financial undertakings should disclose " _the proportion of Taxonomy-eligible and Taxonomy non-eligible economic activities in their total turnover, capital and operational expenditure_ ". 

It follows, therefore, that non-financial undertakings falling under the scope of the non-financial reporting according to the Accounting Directive are required to disclose the three ratios, namely the turnover, CapEx and OpEx in relation to economic activities which are Taxonomy-eligible as defined in Article 1(5) of the Disclosures Delegated Act as well as such eligibility disclosures in relation to economic activities which are non-eligible under the Taxonomy.

Eligibility disclosures could mirror similar preparation and reporting methods as those defined for taxonomy-alignment in the Annexes to the Disclosures Delegated Act.

### How does the Disclosures Delegated Act define capital and operating expenditures?

The Disclosures Delegated Act sets out the definitions of CapEx and OpEx key performance indicators (KPIs) in sections 1.1.2 and 1.1.3 of Annex I respectively. 

Each of these sections includes definitions of the denominator (1.1.2.1 for CapEx and 1.1.3.1 for OpEx) that explains which amounts should be considered as CapEx and OpEx for the purposes of calculating the denominator of the two KPIs for Taxonomy-alignment reporting. 

Furthermore, the sections explain how these calculations should be approached by non-financial undertakings that apply International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and those that apply General Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP).

### Should Taxonomy-eligible economic activities be reported in monetary amounts?

The Annexes to the Disclosures Delegated Act require disclosure of the proportion of Taxonomy-eligible economic activities as well as the absolute numbers of turnover and expenditures (capital and operating) for Taxonomy-alignment reporting.

As a general principle, undertakings are encouraged to prepare for Taxonomy-alignment reporting obligations as they report the proportions of Taxonomy-eligible economic activities in the first year(s) of reporting in accordance with Article 10 of the Disclosures Delegated Act. 

In this regard, undertakings could include on a voluntary basis the monetary amount equivalents of the proportion of their Taxonomy-eligible economic activities for the first year(s) of reporting in accordance with reporting obligations set out in Article 10 of the Disclosures Delegated Act.

### Should financial undertakings report Taxonomy-eligibility based on their underlying entities´ Turnover/CapEx?

Article 10(3) of the Disclosures Delegated Act is silent on the reporting of Taxonomy-eligibility for financial undertakings with regards the KPIs of their underlying entities.

To facilitate comparability in reporting between Taxonomy-eligibility and alignment reporting and to ensure coherence of the reporting across undertakings, it is suggested that disclosures related to Taxonomy-eligibility of the assets and activities of financial undertakings be based on the data related to Taxonomy-eligibility of the activities of their underlying investees or counterparties (turnover and CapEx).

Eligibility disclosures could mirror similar preparation and reporting methods as those defined for taxonomy-alignment in the applicable Annexes to the Disclosures Delegated Act.

### Can financial undertakings use estimates for Taxonomy-eligibility, when information is not available from the reporting firm in 2022?

Eligibility-related disclosures of financial undertakings shall be based on actual information, provided by the financial or non-financial undertaking, per Article 8(4) of the Disclosures Delegated Act. In the case where an underlying undertaking has not yet disclosed its taxonomy-eligibility, a financial undertaking may choose to estimate the proportion of eligibility of economic activities as part of their voluntary disclosure. Such estimated values may only be reported on a voluntary basis and must not form part of the mandatory disclosures.

Moreover, voluntary disclosures should be prepared on the basis that they do not contradict or misrepresent the mandatory information pursuant to the Disclosures Delegated Act and these should not be given more prominence than the mandatory disclosures. Where an undertaking includes voluntary disclosures, this disclosure should be accompanied by supporting detail setting out the basis for this disclosure and methods used for its preparation along with a clear explanation of how it differs from mandatory reporting.

Further guidance on voluntary reporting and use of estimates for eligibility reporting in the first year(s) of reporting is provided by the Platform on Sustainable Finance in its [Appendix](https://ec.europa.eu/info/files/sustainable-finance-taxonomy-eligibility-reporting-voluntary-information_en).(9)[Platform considerations on the reporting of voluntary information as part of Taxonomy-eligibility reporting](https://ec.europa.eu/info/files/sustainable-finance-taxonomy-eligibility-reporting-voluntary-information_en).

### Should financial undertakings 'look through' their investments and portfolios to report Taxonomy-eligibility?

Yes. Disclosure obligations under the Disclosures Delegated Act are intended to provide information to financial undertakings about the extent to which the investments or portfolios are funding taxonomy-aligned activities. 

The same principle and methodology should apply to disclosure of Taxonomy-eligibility. This means that financial undertakings are required to look through their portfolios of investments and assets to assess those investee undertakings that are the ultimate beneficiary and their taxonomy-aligned activities for the purpose of the disclosures required by the Disclosures Delegated Act. 

### What assets are in scope of Taxonomy-eligibility reporting for financial undertakings?

The provisions of Article 10(3) should be read in conjunction with Article 7(1) (2) and (3) of the Disclosures Delegated Act. 

In addition, to facilitate comparability in reporting between Taxonomy-eligibility and alignment reporting and to ensure coherence of the reporting across undertakings, it is suggested that financial and non-financial undertakings use on voluntary basis the templates included in the Annexes to the Disclosures Delegated Act to guide eligibility-related disclosures.

With regards to asset managers, Annex III to the Disclosures Delegated Act, lays out the details of the numerator and denominator for their taxonomy-aligned key performance indicators (KPIs). The numerator consists of a weighted average of the value of investments in Taxonomy-eligible economic activities of investee companies, and the weighted average of the value of investments should be based on the proportion of Taxonomy-eligible economic activities of investee companies. 

With regards to credit institutions, Annexes V and VI to the Disclosures Delegated Act lay out the details of the numerator and denominator for their taxonomy-aligned key performance indicators (KPIs).

### Are derivative instruments in scope of Taxonomy-eligibility reporting?

The requirements under Article 10(3) of the Disclosures Delegated Act should be read in conjunction with Article 7(2) of the same Delegated Act that _says Derivatives shall be excluded from the numerator of key performance indicators of financial undertakings._

Therefore, in the case of Taxonomy-eligibility reporting, derivatives should be excluded from the numerator of financial undertakings´ taxonomy-eligibility reporting, yet included in the denominator of the reported ratios.

Financial undertakings may disclose the proportion of Taxonomy-eligible or aligned derivative instruments on a voluntary basis, separately from the mandatory disclosures(10)Moreover, voluntary disclosures should be prepared on the basis that they do not contradict or misrepresent the mandatory information reported pursuant to the Disclosures Delegated Act and it should not be given more prominence than the mandatory disclosures. Where an undertaking includes voluntary disclosures, this disclosure should be accompanied by supporting detail setting out the basis for this disclosure and methods used for its preparation along with a clear explanation of how it differs from mandatory reporting..

### What activities should an insurer and a reinsurer consider when reporting their underwriting activities in the context of Taxonomy-eligibility reporting?

The activities covered by the underwriting disclosures are determined by the Climate Delegated Act and relate to non-life insurance and reinsurance activities consisting in underwriting of climate-related perils. 

The eligible non-life insurance activities are specified in Annex II to the Climate Delegated Act, Section 10.1, sub-section “Description of the activity”, points (a) to (h). Note that, as indicated in the name of the activity, the insurance line of business must contain a policy with terms related to the treatment of 'climate perils' in view of [Appendix A](./assets/documents/None Appendix A.pdf) to Annex II to the Climate Delegated Act in order to be counted for Taxonomy-eligibility. 

Reinsurance of eligible insurance activities can also be counted for Taxonomy-eligibility (see Annex II to the Climate Delegated Act, Section 10.2, sub-section “Description of the activity”).

### Should insurers and reinsurers consolidate their eligibility disclosures at group-level?

The Disclosures Delegated Act applies to both the non-financial statement and consolidated non-financial statement in accordance with Articles 19a and 29a of the Accounting Directive. 

For the consolidated non-financial statement, insurers and reinsurers should disclose eligibility information and the accompanying statement on a consolidated basis. The preparation of these disclosures should be based on the same consolidation principles that apply to the group’s financial reporting, in order to ensure comparability of this reporting with the group's financial information. 

The consolidated financial statement could include segmental reporting, which can be mirrored in the consolidated non-financial statement.

### How should reinsurers report reinsurance risk/exposure in the absence of insurance policy-level data in 2022?

The reinsurance of eligible insurance is an eligible reinsurance activity (see Annex II to the Climate Delegated Act, Section 10.2, sub-section “Description of the activity”).

The eligible non-life insurance activities are specified in Annex II to the Climate Delegated Act, Section 10.1, sub-section “Description of the activity”, points (a) to (h). 

Reinsurance companies should therefore seek to obtain information on the lines of business of the ceded insurance business in time for the eligibility reporting. 

In the absence of information to perform the assessment, reinsurers could use estimates to report eligibility information on a voluntary basis, and separately from the required eligibility disclosures in accordance with the Disclosures Delegated Act. 

Moreover, voluntary disclosures should be prepared on the basis that they do not contradict or misrepresent the mandatory information reported pursuant to the Disclosures Delegated Act and it should not be given more prominence than the mandatory disclosures. Where an undertaking includes voluntary disclosures, this disclosure should be accompanied by supporting detail setting out the basis for this disclosure and methods used for its preparation along with a clear explanation of how it differs from mandatory reporting.

### Does life insurance qualify as a Taxonomy-eligible activity?

No. The activities covered by the underwriting eligible disclosures are determined by the Climate Delegated Act and relate to non-life insurance consisting of the underwriting of climate-related perils and reinsurance. 

However, life insurers, as investors, are required to disclose eligibility information for their investment activities in accordance with Article 10 of the Disclosures Delegated Act.

### Are the definitions used in the Disclosures Delegated Act reconcilable with those used for FINREP reporting (Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2021/451)?

The definitions used to define on-balance sheet assets for credit institutions in Annex VI to the Disclosures Delegated Act makes reference to the definitions of the [Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2021/451](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32021R0451&from=EN) (FINREP) as follows.

  1. Gross carrying amount of debt instruments shall have the following meaning:
  2. under IFRS and national GAAP based on BAD for debt instruments measured at fair value through profit or loss without being included in the held for trading or trading portfolio, the gross carrying amount shall depend on whether those debt instruments are classified as performing or non-performing. For performing debt instruments, the gross carrying amount shall be the fair value. For non-performing debt instruments, the gross carrying amount shall be the fair value after adding back any accumulated negative changes in fair value due to credit risk, as defined in paragraph 69 of Part 2 of this Annex. For the purposes of the measurement of the gross carrying amount, the valuation of the debt instruments shall be performed on the level of single financial instruments;
  3. under IFRS for debt instruments at amortised cost, the gross carrying amount shall be the carrying amount before adjusting for any loss allowance and for debt instruments at fair value through other comprehensive income, the amortised cost before adjusting for any loss allowance;
  4. under national GAAP based on BAD, for debt instruments classified as ‘non-trading non-derivative financial assets measured at a cost-based method’, the gross carrying amount of impaired assets shall be equal to the carrying amount before adjusting for specific allowances for credit risk. The gross carrying amount of unimpaired assets shall be the carrying amount before adjusting for general allowances for credit risk and general allowances for banking risk, where affecting the carrying amount; 
  5. under national GAAP based on BAD, the gross carrying amount of debt instruments classified as ‘non-trading non-derivative financial assets measured at fair value to equity’ shall depend on whether those financial assets are subject to impairment requirements. Where they are subject to impairment requirements, the gross carrying amount shall be the carrying amount before adjusting for any accumulated impairment, following the requirements in point (c) above for impaired and unimpaired assets, or any accumulated amount of fair value adjustment that is considered as impairment loss. When those financial assets are not subject to impairment requirements, the gross carrying amount of those financial assets shall be the fair value for performing exposures, and for non-performing exposures the fair value after adding back any accumulated negative fair value adjustment due to credit risk;
  6. under national GAAP based on BAD, the gross carrying amount of debt instruments measured at strict or moderate LOCOM shall be the cost where measured at cost during the reporting reference period. Where those debt instruments are measured at market value, the gross carrying amount shall be the market value before adjusting for credit-risk induced value adjustments; 
  7. under national GAAP based on BAD, for debt instruments reported under ‘other non-trading non-derivative financial assets’ under measurement methods other than LOCOM, the gross carrying amount shall be the carrying amount before taking into account any valuation adjustment that qualifies as impairment;
  8. for trading financial assets under GAAP based on BAD or held for trading financial assets under IFRS, the gross carrying amount shall be the fair value. Where GAAP based on BAD require haircuts on trading and fair valued instruments, the carrying amount of the financial instruments shall be the fair value before those haircuts.

### Can green SME debt that is taxonomy-aligned be reported as eligible?

Article 10(3) of the Disclosures Delegated Act clarifies that financial undertakings shall disclose eligible activities having considered the provisions stated under Article 7(3) of the Disclosures Delegated Act.

In accordance with Article 7(3) of the Disclosures Delegated Act, exposures to undertakings that are not obliged to publish non-financial information according to Article 19a or 29a Accounting Directive including SME investments/exposures are excluded from the numerator but included in the denominator of Taxonomy reporting of financial undertakings. 

However, Article 7(4) of the same Delegated Act states that ‘ _without prejudice to paragraph 1, environmentally sustainable bonds or debt securities with the purpose of financing specific identified activities that are issued by an investee undertaking shall be included in the numerator of key performance indicators up to the full value of Taxonomy-aligned economic activities that the proceeds of those bonds and debt securities finance, on the basis of information provided by the investee undertaking_.’

Therefore, financial undertakings should include the proportion of Taxonomy-eligibility of the proceeds of those environmentally sustainable bonds and debt securities whose purpose is to finance specific identified activities, as part of the numerator of the eligibility disclosure. 

Debt securities in Article 7(4) include SME use of proceeds bonds, and do not include SME use of proceed loans, in line with the definitions provided in the Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2021/451 (FINREP).(11)Annex V of the Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2021/451 and Definition of SME Commission Recommendation Article 1 2(a).

As a general remark, the scope of this exclusion from the numerator of the key performance indicator (KPI) is subject to a review by 2024 in accordance with Article 9 of the Disclosures Delegated Act. Furthermore, the adoption and entry into force of the CSRD should enlarge the scope of reporting to listed SMEs.

In addition, the Disclosures Delegated Act does not prevent financial undertakings from including supplementary voluntary information about their exposures to SME investments whose use of proceeds are estimated to be eligible. Such estimates should always be reported separately from the mandated disclosures set out in the Disclosures Delegated Act.(12)Voluntary reporting should be prepared on a basis that does not contradict or misrepresent the mandatory information reported pursuant to the Disclosures Delegated Act and it should not be given more prominence than the mandatory disclosures. Where an undertaking includes voluntary reporting, this should be accompanied by supporting detail setting out the basis for this disclosure and methods used for its preparation along with a clear explanation on how it differs from mandatory reporting.

### How does the Taxonomy Regulation Article 8 Delegated Act interact with the Regulatory Technical Standard (RTS) developed under the Sustainable Finance Disclosures Regulation (SFDR)?

The Disclosures Delegated Act requires transparency on the extent to which the activities of undertakings, subject to an obligation to publish non-financial information pursuant to Article 19a or Article 29a of Directive 2013/34/EU, are taxonomy-aligned. The information disclosed in compliance with the Disclosures Delegated Act could be used as part of other disclosures, such as those falling under the financial product-related transparency requirements of the [Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation (SFDR) (EU) 2019/2088](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32019R2088&from=en). By way of example, where financial products include investments in shares of such undertakings, the financial market participants that offer those financial products should use the taxonomy key performance indicators (KPIs) of investee companies for their own disclosures. 

On 22 October 2021, the European Supervisory Authorities jointly submitted to the Commission draft Regulatory Technical Standards developed under Article 25(2) to (4) of the Taxonomy Regulation. The draft Regulatory Technical Standards specify information required in Articles 5 and 6 of the Taxonomy Regulation on “how and to what extent” financial products referred to in Articles 8 and 9 SFDR invest, or are invested, in sustainable economic activities within the meaning of the Taxonomy Regulation. 

The application of the SFRD or Articles 5 and 6 of the Taxonomy Regulation is not conditional on the formal adoption and entry into force or application of the Regulatory Technical Standards. Financial market participants that offer financial products referred to in Articles 8 and 9 SFDR must comply with the respective requirements set out in the SFRD and in Articles 5 and 6 of the Taxonomy Regulation.

## Complementary Climate Delegated Act

### What is the rationale for the Taxonomy Complementary Climate Delegated Act?

The goal of the EU Taxonomy is to prevent greenwashing and to help investors identify economic activities in line with our environmental and climate objectives. ** ** Shifting towards renewable energy is essential for achieving climate neutrality. But it is also necessary to have stable sources to accelerate the transition towards net-zero greenhouse gas emissions.

The [Taxonomy Regulation](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=celex:32020R0852) lays out three types of activities: low-carbon (Article 10(1)), transitional (Article 10(2)) and enabling (Article 16).

In this Complementary Climate Delegated Act, the Commission includes certain nuclear and gas activities in the second category of activities, i.e. transitional, those covered by Article 10(2) of the Taxonomy Regulation. These are activities that cannot yet be replaced by technologically and economically feasible low-carbon alternatives, but do contribute to climate change mitigation and with the potential to play a major role in the transition to a climate-neutral economy, in line with EU climate goals and commitments, and subject to strict conditions, without crowding out investment in renewables.

Furthermore, this Delegated Act also provides for specific disclosure requirements associated with natural gas and nuclear energy activities included in the act, by amending the Delegated Act on disclosures under Article 8 of the Taxonomy Regulation. This amendment will introduce requirements for large listed non-financial and financial companies to disclose the proportion of their activities linked to natural gas and nuclear energy. This should help investors to distinguish between the different activities they are investing in.

### How ambitious are the technical screening criteria, and do the included activities really lead to environmental benefits, e.g. as compared to energy production from coal?

The Taxonomy Complementary Climate Delegated Act includes strict requirements for the activities to qualify. In the case of fossil gas-related activities, for example, the facility should switch fully to renewable or low-carbon gases by 31 December 2035. This can help accelerate the transition from high-emitting energy sources, such as coal, to renewable or low-carbon gases.

Nuclear power is low-carbon. Expert advice sought by the Commission as part of its preparatory work (the reports of the Technical Expert Group until 2020, and the report of the Joint Research Committee in 2021) confirms this.

Following scientific advice, the Commission has concluded that nuclear energy, subject to strict safety and environmental conditions (including on waste disposal) that ensure the respect of the do no significant harm principle, can play a role in the transition towards climate neutrality in line with the European Green Deal.

### What is the rationale for defining nuclear activities as being in line with the EU's climate and environmental objectives?

The Technical Expert Group on Sustainable Finance, advising the Commission on Taxonomy, acknowledged that nuclear represents a low-carbon energy source. This is in line with the positions of international organisations such as the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and the UN Economic Commission for Europe, which consider CO2 emissions from nuclear power plants over their life-cycle comparable to those from renewable energy sources (as low or even lower).

However, expert opinion has been less conclusive on the other environmental impacts of nuclear power and its compatibility with the “do no significant harm (DNSH)” criterion. For this reason, the Commission set up a specific process on nuclear energy, involving a technical assessment by the Joint Research Centre (JRC), the European Commission's science and knowledge service. Their report was published and reviewed by Member States' experts on radiation protection and waste management appointed by the Scientific and Technical Committee under Article 31 of the Euratom Treaty, as well as by experts from the Scientific Committee on Health, Environmental and Emerging Risks (SCHEER). Overall, the report and reviews conclude that compliance with the safety standards and waste management requirements under the regulatory framework in EU Member States ensures a high level of protection for the environment and for people.

For nuclear energy activities to be enlisted under the taxonomy, the screening criteria set requirements beyond the existing regulatory framework; for instance sunset dates for accelerating transition to advanced technologies, and definite dates for operational disposal facilities to be in place.

### What about considerations on nuclear waste?

The [Taxonomy Regulation](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=celex:32020R0852) requires that the long-term disposal of waste does not cause significant or long-term harm to the environment.

Nuclear energy generates a relatively low amount of waste in comparison to the large amount of generated heat and/or electricity. It produces mainly low-level radioactive waste, for which there are disposal facilities that have operated for decades, while high-level radioactive waste accounts for 1% of total nuclear waste.

The EU regulatory framework establishes the legal requirement for national policies to keep the generation of radioactive waste to a minimum.

In addition, the technical screening criteria for nuclear energy go beyond requiring mere compliance with legislation regarding radioactive waste management and disposal.  Notably, disposal facilities for low-level waste must be operational already, and Member States should have in place a detailed plan to have in operation, by 2050, a disposal facility for high-level radioactive waste. Some Member States have more advanced projects regarding the long-term disposal of nuclear waste. The inclusion of nuclear energy in the EU Taxonomy can accelerate the development of solutions for final waste disposal elsewhere in the EU. In addition, the technical screening criteria for nuclear energy prohibit the export of radioactive waste for disposal in third countries.

### What is the rationale for defining certain gas-related activities as “substantially contributing to” the EU climate and environmental objectives?

During the public consultation conducted in November 2020 for the preparation of the Climate Delegated Act, the energy sector attracted the largest number of responses. Stakeholders notably commented on bioenergy, hydropower, geothermal plants, hydrogen and natural gas. Many stakeholders suggested that natural gas should be recognised for its role as a transition fuel in decarbonisation and that criteria for transitional activities should take into account different starting points across Member States and be attainable with existing technologies. The first EU Taxonomy Climate Delegated Act did not include any transitional activities in the energy sector. However, the European Commission committed to adopting a complementary Delegated Act capturing activities relevant for the climate objectives, but not yet reflected in the first Climate Delegated Act.

The European Union has translated the goal of the Paris Agreement into a long-term European growth strategy. Under the European Green Deal, the EU is working on implementing a comprehensive set of legislative proposals (most recently, [the Fit for 55 Package](https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/IP_21_3541)). The European Commission tabled its proposals based on robust evidence: the Fit for 55 Package rests on a common analytical base with energy system modelling at its core. According to the scenarios in this modelling, natural gas will continue to play an important role in terms of consumption and generation until 2030, after which we expect a decline to 2050. Throughout the transition of our energy system, the function of natural gas-fired electricity generation will change and will increasingly be a facilitator for the spread of renewable electricity and stable supply.

The EU Taxonomy complements these policies and plays a role in transitioning the financial sector to a more sustainable model. The Complementary Delegated Act has been prepared using the same coherent analytical base as the one of the [Climate Target Plan](https://ec.europa.eu/clima/eu-action/european-green-deal/2030-climate-target-plan_en) and the Fit for 55 Package. The Commission's proposal is therefore consistent with the Commission's modelling underpinning its most ambitious legislative package for our climate. The Complementary Delegated Act recognises the specific role of natural gas-related activities in the transition. The carefully crafted set of technical screening criteria ensure that all relevant requirements of the Taxonomy Regulation are complied with. By identifying the role of natural gas in the transition, the Delegated Act also recognises the different situations in our Member States, while contributing to a sustainable transition.

### Unlike nuclear power, natural gas undoubtedly releases CO2 when it is converted into electricity or heat. How can this form of energy lead to environmental benefits?

The Taxonomy Regulation sets out that substantial contribution to climate change mitigation can be achieved through, among other things, the avoidance or reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. Article 10(2) complements this by phasing out greenhouse gas emissions, in particular emissions from solid fossil fuels – a requirement that has been taken into account in the technical screening criteria in the Complementary Delegated Act, along with the other requirements applicable to transitional activities. In the Commission's modelling for Paris-aligned pathways, natural gas is projected to represent 22% of gross inland energy consumption in 2030, and 9% in 2050. Any natural gas in 2050 will have to be abated.

The technical screening criteria ensure that any new gas-based power/heat plant (or refurbished combined heat and power plant or heat/cool plant) is either below the technology-neutral 100g CO2/kWh life-cycle emission threshold (i.e. using Carbon Capture and Storage technologies) or meets a number of stringent conditions and obtains a construction permit by 2030. Importantly, the use of gas should act as a replacement of plants running on more polluting solid and liquid fossil fuels (e.g. coal). As regards the co-generation of heat and power and heating/cooling activities, for every new natural gas-fired plant to be built, a coal-fired plant with the same capacity has to be removed for the technical screening criteria to be complied with. Regarding the power generation, the capacity of the gas-fired plant cannot exceed the capacity of the coal-fired plant by more than 15%. Facilities have to integrate a rapid conversion towards renewables with a clear commitment for a full switch to renewables by 2035.

### What activities and accompanying criteria does the Complementary Climate Delegated Act introduce?

Today's Complementary Climate Delegated Act:

  *  **introduces additional economic activities from the energy sector into the EU Taxonomy.  **The Delegated Act includes in particular certain nuclear energy activities that can play a role, under strict conditions regarding nuclear and environmental safety (also related to waste disposal), in the EU's transition towards climate neutrality. It also covers some gas energy activities as transitional activities, subject to specific conditions which recognise the role gas can play to help some regions transition from the most polluting solid fossil fuel energy sources, such as coal, to renewable energy.
  *  **introduces specific disclosure requirements for businesses related to their activities in the gas and nuclear energy sectors.  **Those requirements should further enhance the information provided to investors and improve transparency.



More specifically, this Complementary Climate Delegated Act covers the following activities:

 **Nuclear-related activities** :

  1. Advanced technologies with closed fuel cycle (“Generation IV”) to incentivise research and innovation into future technologies in terms of safety standards and minimising waste (with no sunset clause);
  2. New nuclear power plant projects for energy generation, which will be using best-available existing technologies (“Generation III+”), will be recognised until 2045 (date of approval of construction permit);
  3. Modifications and upgrades of existing nuclear installations for the purposes of lifetime extension, will be recognised until 2040 (date of approval by competent authority)



 **Gas-related**   **activities** :

Each gas-related activity needs to meet either of the following emission thresholds:

  * lifecycle emissions are below 100gCO2e/kWh, or
  * until 2030 (date of approval of construction permit), and where renewables are not available at sufficient scale, direct emissions are below 270gCO2e/kWh or, for the activity of electricity generation, their annual direct GHG emissions must not exceed an average of 550kgCO2e/kW of the facility's capacity over 20 years. In this case, the activity must meet a set of cumulative conditions: e.g. it replaces a facility using solid or liquid fossil fuels, the activity ensures a full switch to renewable or low-carbon gases by 2035, and a regular independent verification of compliance with the criteria is carried out.



### What are the amendments introduced to the Delegated Act on disclosures under Article 8 of the Taxonomy Regulation?

In order to provide a high degree of market transparency regarding investments in natural gas and nuclear energy activities covered by this Delegated Act, financial and non-financial companies should present specific disclosure requirements that would show to what degree gas and nuclear energy activities, complying with the technical screening criteria, is in the numerator and denominator of the key performance indicators of those undertakings. This should help investors to distinguish among activities they invest in. With the help of this specific disclosure requirement, investors that are not willing to invest in nuclear and gas activities under the conditions in this Delegated Act would be able to identify and invest in activities and financial products that have no exposures to economic activities in the nuclear and gas sectors.

In addition, in order to provide a high degree of transparency to investors in financial products concerning exposures to fossil gas and nuclear energy activities, the Commission will explore amending further the disclosure framework pertaining to those financial products as appropriate, to provide for full transparency over the whole life of those financial products. To ensure that such information is clearly identified by end-investors, the Commission will consider amending the requirements on the financial and insurance advice given by distributors.

## Disclosures Delegated Act - General

### What are the main benefits for financial and non-financial companies associated with this disclosures delegated act?

The Article 8 disclosures delegated act will increase transparency in the market, mitigate risks of greenwashing and subsequent reputational risks for financial institutions. This provision will also increase the space for green finance and encourage financial market participants to design financial products and portfolios on the basis of these disclosures.

Financial institutions need a homogenous and rigorous evaluation of the climate and environmental performance of the companies and assets that they finance. Under this disclosures delegated act, they will be able to use common ratios per company based on turnover, CapEX and OpEx to calculate the overall alignment of their portfolios and balance sheets through weighted aggregation. 

Non-financial companies will be able to communicate the degree of environmental performance of their economic activities and assets to financial institutions, stakeholders and peers. It will enable them translate long-term climate transition and environmental objectives into tangible business strategies.

With this disclosures delegated act, environmental and social benefits are expected due to an increase in capital flows towards environmentally sustainable economic activities, helping to deliver the EU’s climate and environmental objectives as targeted by the Taxonomy Regulation.

### How does this disclosures delegated act interact with the climate delegated act adopted on 4 June and the future environmental delegated act specifying the technical screening criteria for the remaining environmental objectives?

The Taxonomy climate delegated act formally adopted on 4 June 2021 provides the first technical screening criteria for companies and financial market participants on which economic activities can be considered to make a substantial contribution to climate mitigation and adaptation objectives.(4)Available on the website of the Commission: [taxonomy-regulation-delegated-act-2021-2800_en.pdf (europa.eu)](https://ec.europa.eu/finance/docs/level-2-measures/taxonomy-regulation-delegated-act-2021-2800_en.pdf). To complete the climate delegated act, the Commission will subsequently issue a complementary delegated act setting out technical screening criteria for climate mitigation and adaptation objectives notably for some energy sectors and agriculture. 

The taxonomy will also be extended over time to additional environment objectives and should integrate more sectors and activities that make a positive contribution to these objectives through another delegated act to be adopted later.

Article 8 of the Taxonomy Regulation will rely on the above mentioned climate and environmental delegated acts to mandate companies to assess and report the alignment of their financial and non-financial activities with the EU Taxonomy. 

The Article 8 disclosures delegated act and subsequent reporting obligations of financial and non-financial companies is structured so that it automatically integrates upcoming evolutions of the taxonomy and possible amendments brought to the Taxonomy Regulation.

### How does this delegated act interact with the Non-Financial Reporting Directive (NFRD) and related proposal for a Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD)?

Article 8(1) of the Taxonomy Regulation stipulates that any financial and non-financial undertaking in the scope of the NFRD is required to report the extent to which its activities are associated with economic activities that qualify as environmentally sustainable under the Taxonomy Regulation (‘Taxonomy-aligned economic activities’).

This disclosures delegated act, therefore, complements the NFRD by providing a common reference point for taxonomy-related reporting requirements under the two regulations. This disclosures delegated act is also consistent with the specific rules about non-financial reporting provided by the NFRD.

The Commission, through the CSRD proposal published on 21 April 2021, proposes to extend the scope of NFRD requirements to include all large companies, whether they are listed or not and without the previous 500-employee threshold(5)Proposal for a DIRECTIVE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL amending Directive 2013/34/EU, Directive 2004/109/EC, Directive 2006/43/EC and Regulation (EU) No 537/2014, as regards corporate sustainability reporting (COM/2021/189 final).. It responds to demands from investors for sustainability information from such companies. In addition, the CSRD is proposing to extend the scope to include listed small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), with the exception of listed micro-enterprises. 

The scope of undertakings subject to Article 8 of the Taxonomy Regulation will adjust automatically to the changes brought to the NFRD by the CSRD as and where relevant. 

### How will this disclosures delegated act interact with the SFDR and the forthcomings Ecolabel and EU Green Bond Standard?

Taxonomy-related reporting is set to serve as a basis for various future and ongoing initiatives in sustainable finance. 

This disclosures delegated act is developed after the adoption of the SFDR(6)Regulation (EU) 2019/2088 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 November 2019 on sustainability‐related disclosures in the financial services sector (OJ L 317, 9.12.2019, p. 1–16). and should therefore be consistent with the upcoming ‘Regulatory Technical Standards’ (RTS)(7)The European Supervisory Authorities (ESAs) are developing through the Joint Committee (JC) the Regulatory Technical Standards (RTS) with regard to the content, methodologies and presentation of sustainability-related disclosures under empowerments Articles 2a, 4(6) and (7), 8(3), 9(5), 10(2) and 11(4) of Regulation (EU) 2019/2088 (Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation “SFDR”). developed under this regulation. **** Under the SFDR, financial market participants are required to disclose the extent to which their financial products are environmentally sustainable and address adverse sustainability impacts. They shall equally report the extent to which their financial products are aligned with the climate and future environmental delegated acts. While the RTS will specify the taxonomy-alignment of financial products, this disclosures delegated act specifies the extent to which the assets of financial institutions are taxonomy-aligned at the entity level.

The disclosure obligations under this disclosures delegated act will also facilitate the development of Union-wide standards for environmentally sustainable financial products and the establishment of labels that recognise compliance with these standards. Notably, the Commission proposals for an EU Green Bond Standard (EU GBS) and an EU Ecolabel for financial products are expected to rely on the Taxonomy Regulation to demonstrate the alignment of those sustainable financial products with the sustainability goals. 

Taxonomy-related disclosures will therefore enable an entire ecosystem of other sustainable finance tools, including standards, labels and access to a coherent and relevant set of sustainability data, which are necessary to channel capital towards the investments needed to reach Union goals.

### What should non-financial companies report under this disclosures delegated act?

Non-financial companies shall disclose the proportion of environmentally sustainable economic activities **** that align with the EU Taxonomy criteria. The translation of environmental performance into financial variables (turnover, CapEx and OpEx KPIs) allows in turn investors and financial institutions to have clear and comparable data to help them with their investment and financing decisions. The main KPIs for non-financial companies include:

The **turnover** KPI represents the proportion of the net turnover derived from products or services that are taxonomy-aligned. The Turnover KPI gives a static view of the companies contribution to environmental goals.

The **CapEx** KPI represents the proportion of the capital expenditure of an activity that is either already taxonomy-aligned or is part of a credible plan to extend or reach taxonomy-alignment. CapEx provides a dynamic and forward-looking view of companies’ plans to transform their business activities.

The **OpEx** KPI represents the proportion of the operating expenditure associated with taxonomy-aligned activities or to the CapEx plan. The operating expenditure covers direct non-capitalised costs relating to research and development, renovation measures, short-term lease, maintenance and other direct expenditures relating to the day-to-day servicing of assets of property, plant and equipment that are necessary to ensure the continued and effective use of such assets.

The **plan** that accompanies both the CapEx and OpEx KPIs shall be disclosed at the economic activity aggregated level and meet the following conditions:

  * it shall allow extending the scope of taxonomy-aligned economic activities or it shall allow economic activities to become taxonomy-aligned within a period of maximum 10 years;
  * it shall be approved by the management board of non-financial undertakings or another body which has been delegated this task.



This disclosures delegated act considers that a credible plan is a necessary condition to ensure that companies are embarking on a trajectory aimed to make their economic activities taxonomy-aligned. A credible plan should minimise companies´ reputational risks, support their environmental target and develop strategic and forward-looking business decisions. 

In addition, non-financial companies should provide for a **breakdown of the KPIs** based on the economic activity pursued, including transitional and enabling activities, and the environmental objective reached. 

To ensure greater transparency, specific accompanying information should be reported for the share of economic activities that are described in the Commission’s delegated acts, but that do not yet meet the relevant technical screening criteria (‘ **taxonomy-eligible economic activities’)** and the share of economic activities that are not covered by the Taxonomy-related delegated acts. The companies are not required to disclose the assessments about the technical screening criteria that Taxonomy-eligible economic activities fail to meet, but may do so voluntarily, in particular to attract investors to finance their plans to reach taxonomy-alignment in the future. The combination of this accompanying information with the three KPIs is important for a company to finance and show over time the transition of its taxonomy-eligible economic activities towards taxonomy-alignment. 

Finally, this disclosures delegated act requires non-financial companies to provide for **accompanying qualitative information** about the calculation and the key elements for change of the three KPIs during the reporting period. 

### What should financial companies report under this disclosures delegated act?

The main KPIs for financial companies (banks, investment firms, asset managers, insurers/reinsurers) relate to the proportion of taxonomy-aligned economic activities in their financial activities, such as lending, investment and insurance. 

  1. **Credit institutions (banks)**



Credit institutions shall report a main KPI for on-balance sheet assets related to the financing activities (e.g. lending activities). They should report as well KPIs for off-balance sheet assets and, subject to a phase-in period, a KPI for commissions and fees related to other non- financing activities and, where relevant, a KPI for their trading book. 

**The main KPI for credit institutions is the Green Asset Ratio (GAR)** that is defined as the proportion of the credit institutions’ assets invested in taxonomy-aligned economic activities as a share of total _covered asset_ s(8)Total covered assets makes reference to all on-balance sheet exposures expect for sovereign exposures and trading portfolio. See also question 9 below.. 

The GAR should be calculated based on the on-balance sheet exposures (total covered assets) according to the prudential scope of consolidation for the types of assets. Credit institutions should disclose the aggregate GAR for on-balance sheet covered assets and provide for a breakdown for the environmental objective pursued by environmentally sustainable assets, the type of counterparty, and the subset of transitional and enabling activities.

The main GAR should cover the **stock** of credit institutions (existing on-balance sheet total covered assets). An additional GAR is provided for the **flows** (e.g. new loans and advances).

The definition of the KPIs is based on the following components where: 

  * the **numerator** covers the loans and advances, debt securities, equities, repossessed collaterals financing taxonomy-aligned economic activities, thus capturing total taxonomy-aligned exposures; 
  * the **denominator** covers the total on-balance sheet covered assets. 



The level of taxonomy alignment of banks’ exposures should be given by the level of Taxonomy alignment of the assets that they finance or either the turnover KPI or the CapEx KPI of the non-financial companies that banks are financing or investing in.

The green ratio for financial guarantees to corporates ( **FinGuar KPI** ) is defined as a proportion of financial guarantees supporting debt instruments to undertakings financing taxonomy-aligned economic activities compared to all financial guarantees supporting debt securities to undertakings. The green ratio for assets under management ( **AuM KPI** ) is defined as a proportion of assets under management (equity and debt instruments) financing taxonomy-aligned economic activities, compared to total _covered_ assets under management (equity and debt instruments). 

The KPI for fees and commission income **(F &C KPI) **is linked to services associated with taxonomy-aligned economic activities and shall be defined as a proportion of the institution’s fees and commission income derived from products or services other than lending associated with taxonomy-aligned economic activities, compared to total fees and commissions from products or services other than lending. Where a trading portfolio plays an important role in the business model of credit institutions, they shall disclose their trading book KPI that determines the proportion of Taxonomy-aligned instruments of in their overall trading. 

  *     1. **Investment firms**



Investment firms shall disclose a KPI for their core investment services and activities dealing on own account and a KPI for those services and activities not dealing on own account.(9)This includes services and activities listed in Section A of Annex I of Directive 2014/65/EU (MiFID), such as reception and transmission of orders in relation to one or more financial instruments; execution of orders on behalf of clients; dealing on own account; portfolio management; investment advice; underwriting of financial instruments and/or placing of financial instruments on a firm commitment basis; placing of financial instruments without a firm commitment basis; operation of an MTF; operation of an OTF.

Investment firms shall rely on the underlying investee companies’ KPIs to compute the GAR for investment firms’ services and activities dealing on own account.

  *     1.  **Asset managers**



Asset managers should report the proportion of taxonomy-aligned investments managed by an asset manager in the value of all covered assets under management from both its collective and individual portfolio management activities ( **Green Investment Ratio** )(10)Covered assets under management makes reference to all AuM except for sovereign exposures. See question 9 below.. 

The weighted average of taxonomy-aligned investments should be based on the share of taxonomy-aligned economic activities of investee companies. Asset managers shall rely on the underlying investee companies’ KPIs to compute their own Green Investment Ratio.

Asset managers shall in addition provide for a breakdown for each environmental objective and for aggregated environmentally sustainable economic activities, a subset of transitional and enabling economic activities and the type of investments.

  *     1.  **Insurers/reinsurers**



Insurance or reinsurance undertakings shall disclose **the KPIs related to their investments and underwriting activities**. The investment KPI relates to the investment policy of insurers and reinsurance undertakings for the funds resulting from their underwriting activities. The underwriting KPI relates directly to their underwriting activities.

The KPI related to investments shall be calculated as the proportion of the investments of insurance or reinsurance undertakings that are associated with taxonomy-aligned economic activities in relation to their investments (see Green Investment Ratio in the asset management section). As for asset managers, insurers shall rely on the underlying investee companies’ KPIs to compute their own investment KPI.

The KPI related to underwriting activities shall be calculated as the proportion of the ‘non-life gross premiums written’ corresponding to taxonomy-aligned insurance activities as defined in the Taxonomy Climate Delegated Act in relation to total non-life gross premiums written.

### How does this disclosures delegated act treat exposures to companies that are not subject to the reporting under this delegated act (SMEs, non-EU companies) in the reporting of financial companies?

Companies not subject to the NFRD, including SMEs (‘non-NFRD undertakings’) may decide to voluntarily disclose their taxonomy-alignment KPIs for the purpose of accessing environmentally sustainable finance, e.g. as part of eco-labelling schemes and environmentally sustainable products based on alignment with Taxonomy Regulation or as part of their overall business strategy based on environmental sustainability. 

However, to provide SMEs and/or non-EU companies with sufficient time to adjust to the new situation and to decide whether to report voluntarily under the Taxonomy Regulation and financial institutions to collect relevant information from those undertakings, this disclosures delegated act provides that financial undertakings should not include such information in the numerator of their own KPIs. The information may be included from 1 January 2025, subject to a review and outcome of an impact assessment. (11)Prior to the inclusion of SMEs exposures in the numerator of KPIs of financial institutions, the Commission will assess the administrative burden, access to finance and the potential impacts on SMEs of such an inclusion and will ensure that any disproportionate impacts on SMEs are avoided.

Such assets are included in the denominator of the financial institutions´ KPIs to show the share of those assets in the total assets of financial undertakings with the relevant accompanying information.(12)The reporting of the overall KPI should be qualified by accompanying information to clarify that those assets or companies excluded from the numerator, yet included in the denominator, have been excluded either because their activities are not covered by the Taxonomy framework (e.g. administrative services) or for lack of information, limited data availability from the underlying companies themselves about the activities covered by the Taxonomy framework. Further information about accompanying qualitative information is provided in the next section.

The application of KPIs of financial companies in relation to those undertakings will be reviewed over time, as part of the general review of this disclosures delegated act.

### How does this disclosures delegated act treat exposures to government entities in the reporting of financial companies?

This delegated act excludes sovereign exposures of financial institutions from both the denominator and the numerator of their green ratios(13)Exposures to central governments, central banks and supranational issuers are excluded from the numerator and denominator of the KPI of financial undertakings. By 30 June 2024, the Commission shall review the application of this Regulation. Financial undertakings may, on a voluntary basis, provide information in relation to exposures to taxonomy aligned bonds and taxonomy aligned debt securities that are issued by central governments, central banks or supranational issuers. The Commission shall assess in particular the need for any further amendments with the regard to inclusion of sovereign exposures in the KPI calculation..

### Does this disclosures delegated act include derivatives in scope of the reporting of financial companies?

Derivatives are excluded from the numerator of KPIs of financial companies in view of their primary use in mitigating counterparty risk rather than to finance an asset or an economic activity.

Derivative exposures are, however, included in the denominator of the green ratios of financial institutions as they should cover the total assets of financial institutions. 

### What is the timeframe for adoption and implementation of this disclosures delegate act, and will there be a phased entry into force?

Given the time needed to appropriately implement the Delegated Act and the planned entry into force of the Climate Delegated Act by the end of 2021, the following time sequence is outlined in the Delegated Act for the application of disclosures:

  * As of 1st January 2022 for the reporting period 2021, only qualitative information and information on the proportion of taxonomy-eligible activities in relation to total activities set out in the Delegated Act must be disclosed.
  * As of 1 January 2023 for the reporting period 2022, the Delegated Act will apply fully to non-financial undertakings and as 1 January 2024 for the reporting period 2023 to financial undertakings with the understanding that certain exposures and investments of financial institutions, including in sovereign debt and non-NFRD undertakings, may not have been fully reflected in their KPIs.
  * By 30 June 2024, the delegated act will be reviewed in particular with respect to the treatment in the KPIs of exposures of financial undertakings to sovereigns and non-NFRD undertakings;
  * As of 1 January 2026 for the reporting period 2025, the Delegated Act will apply for the KPIs of credit institutions for the trading book and non-banking services.



### Once adopted, will this disclosures delegated act be reviewed?

The disclosures delegated act allows for future revisions after an appropriate time following its application. The review shall take into account the application, developments and future revisions of the Taxonomy Regulation, as well as the regulatory technical standards related to product disclosures (e.g. SFDR) and possible developments related to the review of the NFRD (CSRD proposal).

By 30 June 2024, the Commission shall assess in particular the need for any further amendments to this delegated act with regards to the inclusion of sovereign exposures in the scope of the KPIs of financial institutions and inclusion of exposures to non-NFRD undertakings in the numerator of KPIs of financial institutions. 

Frequently Asked Questions for more information about the EU Taxonomy and Climate Delegated Acts: [Q&A (europa.eu)](https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/qanda_21_1805).

## EU Taxonomy - General

### What is the EU Taxonomy?

The EU Taxonomy is a green classification system that translates the EU’s climate and environmental objectives into criteria for specific economic activities for investment purposes. 

It recognises as green, or ‘environmentally sustainable’, economic activities that make a **substantial** contribution to at least one of the EU’s climate and environmental objectives, while at the same time not significantly harming any of these objectives and meeting minimum social safeguards. 

The Taxonomy Delegated Acts will establish and maintain clear criteria for activities to define what it means to make a substantial contribution and what it means to do no significant harm.

It is a transparency tool that will introduce mandatory disclosure obligations on some companies and investors, requiring them to disclose their share of Taxonomy-aligned activities. This disclosure of the proportion of Taxonomy-aligned activities will allow for the comparison of companies and investment portfolios. In addition, it can guide market participants in their investment decisions. 

Companies, if they wish, can reliably use the EU Taxonomy to plan their climate and environmental transition and raise finance for this transition. Financial companies, if they wish, can use the EU Taxonomy to design credible green financial products. 

Nevertheless, the EU Taxonomy is not a mandatory list of economic activities for investors to invest in. Nor does it set mandatory requirements on environmental performance for companies or for financial products. Investors are free to choose what to invest in. However, it is expected that over time, the EU Taxonomy will be an enabler of change and encourage a transition towards sustainability.

Economic activities that are not recognised by the EU Taxonomy Delegated Acts as substantially contributing to one of the EU’s climate and environmental objectives are not necessarily environmentally harmful or unsustainable. And not all activities that can make a substantial contribution to the environmental objectives are yet part of the EU Taxonomy Delegated Acts. Delegated acts will be living documents that will be added to over time and updated as necessary. 

### What is the Taxonomy Climate Delegated Act?

The EU Taxonomy provides a common understanding of economic activities that make a substantial contribution to the EU’s environmental goals, by providing consistent, objective criteria in delegated acts. The Taxonomy Regulation tasks the Commission with establishing these technical screening criteria through delegated acts. 

The first delegated act under the EU Taxonomy on climate objectives sets criteria for economic activities in the sectors that are most relevant for achieving climate neutrality and delivering on climate change adaptation. This includes sectors such as energy, forestry, manufacturing, transport and buildings. The process leading up to the adoption of this Delegated Act is explained in the answer to question 18.

Criteria for other environmental goals will follow in a later delegated act, in line with the mandates in the Taxonomy Regulation. The Commission is currently preparing an IT tool to facilitate the use of the Taxonomy by allowing users to find the criteria more easily, for example by selecting the type of economic activity they are interested in. 

### Why do we need an EU Taxonomy?

We need reliable tools to support companies in the transition to climate neutrality and a sustainable economy. The EU Taxonomy is one such tool, translating the climate and environmental objectives into clear criteria, to create a common language around green activities. It will create a frame of reference for investors and companies. It will support companies in their efforts to plan and finance their transition, help mitigate market fragmentation, protect against greenwashing and accelerate financing of those projects that are already sustainable and those in transition, to deliver on the objectives of the European Green Deal.

It is an important element of a much broader sustainable finance framework that will deliver a complete toolkit for financing the transition. The added value of the EU Taxonomy is that it can help scale up investment in green projects that are necessary to implement the European Green Deal.

### How does the EU Taxonomy fit within the broader sustainable finance framework?

There are three disclosure tools that create one coherent framework:

  * The[ Non-Financial Reporting](https://ec.europa.eu/info/business-economy-euro/company-reporting-and-auditing/company-reporting/non-financial-reporting_en) [Directive (NFRD)](https://ec.europa.eu/info/business-economy-euro/company-reporting-and-auditing/company-reporting/non-financial-reporting_en) is currently being revised (named after revision as Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive - CSRD), with the aim of delivering a comprehensive corporate reporting framework with qualitative and quantitative information to facilitate the assessment of companies’ sustainability impacts and risks. 
  * The **EU Taxonomy** establishes a common understanding of green economic activities that make a substantial contribution to EU environmental goals, by providing consistent, objective criteria. Together with the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) these two instruments will ensure that companies falling under the scope of the CSRD disclose the environmental performance information of the company as well as information about a company’s Taxonomy-aligned economic activities.
  * The[ Sustainable Finance Disclosure](https://ec.europa.eu/info/business-economy-euro/banking-and-finance/sustainable-finance/sustainability-related-disclosure-financial-services-sector_en) [Regulation (SFDR)](https://ec.europa.eu/info/business-economy-euro/banking-and-finance/sustainable-finance/sustainability-related-disclosure-financial-services-sector_en) applies from 10 March 2021 and complements corporate disclosures by creating a comprehensive reporting framework for financial products and financial entities. Compliance with sustainability-related disclosures is expected to have considerable behavioural effects on financial firms, and indirectly on the business models of companies that are being invested in. Different investment strategies may entail investments in economic activities with different levels of environmental performance. For this reason, the SFDR distinguishes disclosure requirements for:
  * financial products that claim to have ‘sustainable investment’ as their objective (in the case of environmental objectives these are often referred to as ‘dark green’ financial products);
  * financial products that claim to be promoting social or environmental characteristics (often referred to as ‘light green’ financial products).



The SFDR requirements are linked with those under the EU Taxonomy by including ‘environmentally sustainable economic activities’ as defined by the Taxonomy Regulation in the definition of ‘sustainable investments’ in the SFDR. But neither the SFDR nor the Taxonomy Regulation provide criteria and define eligible investments or strategies for so-called ‘light green’ financial products. Therefore, the ESG ambition of ‘light green’ financial products may vary: for example, certain ‘light green’ financial products may partially pursue sustainable investments. Regulatory technical standards jointly developed by ESMA, EBA and EIOPA further specify disclosure requirements for ‘dark green’ and ‘light green’ financial products in terms of substance as well as presentation of information by means of standardised templates across the financial services sectors.

### How does the EU Taxonomy define green economic activities?

[The Taxonomy Regulation ](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:32020R0852)lays out six EU environmental objectives: 

  * climate change mitigation,
  * climate change adaptation, 
  * sustainable use and protection of water and marine resources, 
  * transition to a circular economy, 
  * pollution prevention and control, and
  * protection and restoration of biodiversity and ecosystems.



It also sets out four conditions that an economic activity has to meet to be recognised as Taxonomy- aligned:

  * making a substantial contribution to at least one environmental objective;
  * doing no significant harm to any other environmental objective;
  * complying with minimum social safeguards;
  * complying with the technical screening criteria.



This technical screening criteria are developed in delegated acts. For each economic activity considered, the technical screening criteria specify environmental performance requirements that ensure the activity makes a **substantial contribution to the environmental objective** in question and **does no significant harm** to the other environmental objectives.

The technical screening criteria for ‘substantial contribution’ to an environmental objective ensure that the economic activity either has a substantial positive environmental impact or substantially reduces negative impacts on the environment, e.g. substantially reduced levels of greenhouse gas emissions. 

The technical screening criteria for ‘do no significant harm’ ensure that the economic activity does not impede on the other environmental objectives from being reached, i.e. it has no significant negative impact on them. 

Both sets of criteria together ensure coherence between the objectives in the EU Taxonomy and guarantee that progress towards one objective is not made at the expense of another.

The performance thresholds in these criteria are science-based and developed on the basis of a robust methodology and an inclusive process. They identify criteria for economic activities that can set sectors on a path consistent with the EU’s climate and environmental goals, based on currently available technologies.

Substantial contribution to climate change mitigation, for example, means levels of performance that are aligned with climate neutrality and limiting the increase in temperature to 1.5 degrees Celsius globally. For climate change adaptation this means the implementation of solutions to substantially reduce the most significant identified climate risks to a particular activity such as wildfires, storms or droughts. The Taxonomy Regulation calls such activities ‘environmentally sustainable’: but this does not mean that activities that do not meet these four conditions are ‘unsustainable’.

Economic activities can make a substantial contribution through the specific means listed in Articles 10 to 15 of the Taxonomy Regulation. Based on these provisions, the draft Delegated Act contains a number of activities that can make a substantial contribution and defines criteria for those activities to qualify as green under the EU Taxonomy. The methodology used by the Commission is based on the work by the Technical Expert Group (TEG). It considers that activities can make a substantial contribution when: 

  * they have a low impact on the environment and have the potential to replace high impact activities (e.g. renewable energy);
  * they reduce impact from other activities (e.g. wastewater treatment); or
  * they make a positive environmental contribution (e.g. restoration of wetlands).



These are not types of activities explicitly listed in the Taxonomy Regulation. Instead, they are ways to understand and frame the concept of ‘substantial contribution’, based on Articles 10 to 15 of the Taxonomy Regulation.

In addition, the Taxonomy Regulation explicitly recognises two specific types of activities that also make a substantial contribution. First, for the climate change mitigation objective, it recognises ‘transitional activities’. These are activities for which low-carbon alternatives are not yet available and that have greenhouse gas emission levels that correspond to the best performance in the sector or industry. For example, this might include best-in-class cement manufacturing. Nevertheless, there are two conditions: (i) they should not hamper the development and deployment of low-carbon alternatives and (ii) they should not lead to a lock-in of carbon-intensive assets, considering the economic lifetime of those assets.

The second specific type of activity recognised as making a substantial contribution is referred to as ‘enabling activities’. These are activities that directly enable others to make a substantial contribution to an environmental objective. For example, this could include manufacturing of renewable energy technologies, installation of energy efficiency equipment in buildings, research into materials for stronger flood defences, or use of cover crops that reduce the risk of flooding for an area.

### What is the level of ambition of the EU Taxonomy ‘substantial contribution’ criteria? Why is it something higher than EU sectoral legislation?

The EU Taxonomy recognises as ‘green’ activities those that – beside doing no significant harm and meeting minimum social safeguards – make a **substantial** , rather than a marginal, contribution to reaching the EU’s environmental objectives. It sets the criteria based on a level of ambition that strengthens the EU’s credibility and signals the activities that can substantially contribute to the goals of the European Green Deal. Given the huge investment needs and the necessary broad transformation of the EU economy, less than substantial improvements on the current levels of environmental performance - while still important - will in themselves not be sufficient to reach our green objectives.

Alignment with EU sectoral policies is an important consideration. But there are good reasons why the Taxonomy criteria might both integrate and go beyond sectoral policies, the prevailing aim being alignment of the Taxonomy criteria with the ambition of the European Green Deal objectives. Also, there is a particular difference between requirements for a ‘substantial contribution’ and requirements for ‘doing no significant harm’.

Estimates and early testing of the climate taxonomy criteria show a low overall Taxonomy alignment today in companies’ activities and investment portfolios (between 1% and 5%, with many companies and investment portfolios standing at zero). While this figure is expected to rise significantly with the implementation of the Green Deal, it highlights the extent of the transition still required towards carbon neutrality by 2050.

### What is the coverage of the EU Taxonomy and why are some sectors or activities not covered?

The European Parliament and the Council have prioritised economic activities that can make the most relevant contribution to the two environmental objectives under consideration. This first Delegated Act focuses on the climate objectives (climate change mitigation and climate change adaptation) and therefore includes activities that are most relevant for reductions in greenhouse gas emissions and for improving climate resilience. This includes sectors with the highest contribution to CO2 emissions (energy, manufacturing, transport, buildings), as well as activities enabling their transformation, because the transformation of activities in these sectors is necessary to reach the EU’s climate objectives. 

Through the Taxonomy Climate Delegated Act, the EU Taxonomy criteria cover the economic activities of roughly 40% of listed companies,(0)Share of EU domiciled companies with more than 500 employees active in economic sectors covered by the EU Taxonomy Climate Delegated Act (Source: Bloomberg). in sectors which are responsible for almost 80% of direct greenhouse gas emissions in Europe.(1)Source: Eurostat. Through this coverage, the EU Taxonomy can significantly increase the potential that green financing offers to support transition, in particular for carbon-intensive sectors where change is urgently needed. 

It was not possible however to develop criteria for all sectors where activities could conceivably make a substantial contribution. The EU Taxonomy will be developed gradually over time, and further delegated acts, or revisions of existing ones, will likely include other economic activities from different sectors and sub-sectors of the economy, as these become relevant and feasible to be integrated into the EU Taxonomy. For example, the review of the criteria on forest management and bioenergy are foreseen in the Taxonomy Climate Delegated Act itself. 

Stakeholders will have an opportunity to notify the Platform on Sustainable Finance about activities they believe should be covered in the EU Taxonomy. The assessment of further economic activities will also be based on scientific evidence and broad stakeholder input. Gradually, additional sectors will be considered and additional activities will be included. For more information on the EU Taxonomy, including information on the gradual inclusion of economic sectors and activities, please see the[ FAQ ](https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/business_economy_euro/banking_and_finance/documents/200610-sustainable-finance-teg-taxonomy-green-bond-standard-faq_en.pdf)previously prepared by the Commission and Technical Expert Group on EU Taxonomy & EU Green Bond Standard.

Furthermore, the Taxonomy Climate Delegated Act reflects a delicate compromise on whether or not to include nuclear energy and natural gas among the activities covered by the Act. For this reason, in line with the legal framework and our past commitments, the Commission will adopt a complementary delegated act of the EU Taxonomy Regulation covering activities not yet covered in the EU Taxonomy Climate Delegated Act such as agriculture, certain energy sectors and certain manufacturing activities. An additional delegated act will cover the other four environmental objectives as set out in the Taxonomy Regulation.

A specific review process is underway on the role of nuclear energy as part of the Taxonomy Regulation, based on the report delivered by the Joint Research Centre,(2)[JRC report: Technical assessment of nuclear energy with respect to the ‘do no significant harm’ criteria of Regulation (EU) 2020/852 (‘Taxonomy Regulation’) | European Commission (europa.eu)](https://ec.europa.eu/info/file/210329-jrc-report-nuclear-energy-assessment_en) which is now being assessed by two expert committees,(3)The [Scientific Committee on Health, Environmental and Emerging Risks](https://ec.europa.eu/health/scientific_committees/scheer_en), as well as the [Scientific Committee on Health, Environmental and Emerging Risks](https://ec.europa.eu/health/scientific_committees/scheer_en) on environmental impacts. which will finalise their review in June 2021. The Commission will adopt this complementary Delegated Act as soon as possible after the end of this specific review process. This complementary delegated act will also cover natural gas and related technologies as transitional activity in as far as they fall within the limits of Article 10(2) of the EU Taxonomy Regulation. 

Finally, a separate delegated act will focus on activities making a substantial contribution the other four environmental objectives as set out in the EU Taxonomy Regulation (sustainable use and protection of water and marine resources, transition to a circular economy, pollution prevention and control, protection and restoration of biodiversity and ecosystems). The Platform on Sustainable Finance is working on recommendations for this act.

In addition, Article 26 of the EU Taxonomy Regulation requires the Commission to assess by the end of 2021 whether and how the scope of the Taxonomy Regulation could be extended to cover other levels of environmental performance than substantial contribution, as well as other objectives, such as social objectives.

### How will companies use the EU Taxonomy?

There are some mandatory disclosure rules defined in the Taxonomy Regulation. Alongside these, companies can also use the EU Taxonomy voluntarily.

### Mandatory use: disclosure

The EU Taxonomy Regulation sets mandatory requirements on disclosure, with the aim of providing transparency on environmental performance.

Large financial and non-financial companies that fall under the scope of the Non-Financial Reporting Directive will have to disclose to what extent the activities that they carry out meet the criteria set out in the EU Taxonomy. Likewise, financial market participants (such as asset managers) will have to disclose to what extent the activities that their financial products fund meet the EU Taxonomy criteria. Companies will be able to disclose the extent to which they invest, for example through capital expenditures, in either expanding or strengthening their activities which are already Taxonomy-aligned, or to upgrade other activities to make them Taxonomy-aligned. Disclosure on green revenue and green expenditure will provide the market with information on (1) companies whose activities comply with the EU Taxonomy criteria (through disclosure of share revenue from Taxonomy-aligned activities) and (2) companies that are taking steps to get there (through disclosure of green expenditure).

For more information on reporting obligations, please see the[ FAQ ](https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/business_economy_euro/banking_and_finance/documents/200610-sustainable-finance-teg-taxonomy-green-bond-standard-faq_en.pdf)previously prepared by the Commission and Technical Expert Group on the EU Taxonomy & EU Green Bond Standard. The details of these reporting requirements will be further specified in an upcoming delegated act under Article 8 of the Taxonomy Regulation and in Regulatory Technical Standards to be adopted under Articles 8, 9 and 11 of the Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation.

### Voluntary use: guide for investments

There are many possible voluntary uses of the EU Taxonomy by market participants, which are not defined in policy instruments. For example, companies can use the criteria of the EU Taxonomy as an input to their environmental and sustainability transition strategies and plans. Companies and project promoters can choose to meet the criteria of the EU Taxonomy with the aim of attracting investors interested in green opportunities. Investors can choose to use the EU Taxonomy criteria in their due diligence for screening and identifying sustainable investment opportunities aiming to achieve a positive environmental impact.

### Will the EU Taxonomy be used elsewhere too?

Green standards and labels

The Taxonomy Regulation requires Member States and the EU to use the EU Taxonomy as the basis of any EU or national (public) labels for green corporate bonds or financial products that fall under the scope of the SFDR. The EU Taxonomy therefore provides a good basis for the development of further sustainable finance tools, including the EU[ Ecolabel for R](https://susproc.jrc.ec.europa.eu/product-bureau/product-groups/432/home)etail Financial Products and future EU standards for[ green bonds ](https://ec.europa.eu/info/business-economy-euro/banking-and-finance/sustainable-finance/eu-green-bond-standard_en)(all under development) as well as green mortgages.

Ongoing EU policy initiatives will link standards and labels to Taxonomy aligned economic activities:

  * In the current draft EU Ecolabel criteria for financial products, there is a requirement for a certain share of underlying activities invested in to be Taxonomy aligned. Thus, the EU Ecolabel will be awarded to financial products only if the companies they invest in carry out Taxonomy-aligned activities. It will be useful to have an ecolabel for financial products especially for retail investors who have corresponding sustainability preferences.
  * The EU Green Bond Standard (GBS) will define requirements for entities wishing to issue green bonds and claim compliance with this standard. These standards will include a requirement for companies to ensure that the proceeds raised through a bond issuance are used to finance Taxonomy-aligned activities.
  * The EU Climate Benchmarks Regulation lays down minimum standards for the creation of two types of climate benchmarks - EU climate transition and EU Paris-aligned benchmarks. These are to be made consistent with the EU Taxonomy by the end of 2022. The Commission will reflect on how to implement this obligation in practical terms and what obligations will be put on benchmark administrators for the selected companies or entities to form part of such benchmarks. It could be that benchmark administrators have to select companies that have a certain percentage of their activities classified as green as per the Taxonomy or that companies are excluded because they do not meet certain thresholds. The two EU climate benchmarks are largely used by market participants for the allocation of assets and should contribute to showcasing companies that have an impact on tackling climate change.



EU instruments making reference to the EU Taxonomy

In addition to the mandatory uses set out in the Taxonomy Regulation discussed above, there are other EU (or national) policies that may refer to the Taxonomy Regulation. Such uses are not defined or mandated in the Taxonomy Regulation itself, but in other policy instruments, and do not necessitate the use of the Taxonomy criteria defined in the associated delegated acts. One area where the EU Taxonomy framework might be used, if deemed appropriate, is the design of financial support schemes or financial products. National Promotional Banks or Institutions may make reference to the EU Taxonomy framework to provide financial support to green investments at national level, or when proposing financing for green projects under the[ InvestEU ](https://europa.eu/investeu/home_en)Programme.

Another important example is the use of the ‘do no significant harm’ principle of the Taxonomy Regulation in the[ Recovery and Resilience Facility ](https://ec.europa.eu/info/business-economy-euro/recovery-coronavirus/recovery-and-resilience-facility_en)(RRF). Here, the ‘do no significant harm principle’ is applied within the meaning of Article 17 of the Taxonomy Regulation but without requiring the use of the delegated acts and related technical screening criteria. Instead, the Commission published on 12 February 2021 a technical guidance document, providing more details on how to apply the ‘do no significant harm’ principle for the purposes of the RRF.

Similarly, based on the political agreement reached between the Council and the European Parliament on new rules for EU regional, cohesion and social funds for the period of 2021-2027, budget expenditure as part of those funds will also need to respect the ‘do no significant harm’ principle within the meaning of Article 17 of the Taxonomy Regulation. For the 2021/2022 work programme, the ‘do no significant harm’ principle was introduced when setting the call topics under the new EU Research Framework Programme,[ Horizon Europe.](https://ec.europa.eu/info/horizon-europe_en%23:~:text=%2520Horizon%2520Europe%2520%25201%2520Implementing%2520Horizon%2520Europe,European%2520partnerships%2520with%2520EU%2520countries,%2520the...%2520More)

### How can companies benefit from having Taxonomy-aligned activities?

Companies that fall under the scope of the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) will be disclosing to the financial markets whether or not they have Taxonomy-aligned activities. Investors will have access to this information and can make investment decisions accordingly. Companies with Taxonomy-aligned activities will benefit from institutional investors, retail investors and banks interested in green investments, as they will be looking to finance Taxonomy-aligned economic activities.

Investors that want to make a positive environmental impact will be interested in Taxonomy-aligned economic activities because they will know the given activity lives up to the established gold standard; i.e., has a high level of environmental performance and makes a substantial contribution.

Institutional investors can design their financial products in such a way as to fund some Taxonomy-aligned activities. Those under the scope of the SFDR will have to comply with mandatory disclosures whereby they also need to show to what extent, if any, there are underlying Taxonomy-aligned investments in the financial products they offer.

Large banks might also have an incentive to finance Taxonomy-aligned economic activities, for example through lending. This means that a company applying for a bank loan may be able to get a better interest rate if the purpose of the loan is to reach Taxonomy alignment of a given activity, or to fund Taxonomy-aligned activities.

Retail investors are increasingly interested in green financial products. Given the upcoming amendments to the requirements for portfolio management and investment advice, those providing investment services need to consider the client’s sustainability preferences as well as their risk profile. This opens a channel for retail investors to state whether they prefer to invest in financial products that have a positive environmental impact or to avoid investing in those that do not, so that they can be offered financial products that match their preferences. Taking into account retail investors’ sustainability preferences when they are given financial advice creates better opportunities for companies with Taxonomy-aligned activities to reach retail investors.

While it is not mandatory for companies to ensure their economic activities meet the criteria of the Taxonomy, it provides a motivation for companies to strive to reach a level of environmental performance that financial markets recognise as green. The Taxonomy Regulation, along with the SFDR, CSRD, and ongoing policy initiatives such as the EU Ecolabel for retail financial products and the EU Green Bond Standard, will ensure that Taxonomy-aligned activities are visible and recognised in investment decisions. Companies that wish to make a substantial contribution to reaching the climate and environmental objectives can voluntarily decide to use these criteria when planning their transition to sustainability.

### How does the EU Taxonomy help companies transition towards sustainability?

The EU Taxonomy criteria provide a reference point for companies in their decision-making regarding their green transition. Companies can use the EU Taxonomy to improve their overall environmental performance (either by upgrading current activities or starting new activities) and to attract investors.

The EU Taxonomy criteria are defined at the level of economic activities. Therefore, assessing the degree of alignment of a company with the EU Taxonomy requires checking the performance of its activities against the criteria.

In practice, the reporting procedures and resource planning will likely be organised at the level of the legal entity – or entities - of a given company. Legal entities would assess and report the percentage of their activities that are Taxonomy-aligned, expressed as the share of their Taxonomy-aligned turnover or expenditures (capital and operational). This information would then be aggregated across legal entities for the company as a whole.

By focusing on the activity level, the Taxonomy supports companies in their transition. It provides incentives to gradually increase their share of green economic activities to attract more investors or possibly new and different types of investors.

Knowing the current environmental performance at the level of an activity will encourage companies to make transition plans and implement measures that get their activities to meet the EU Taxonomy criteria. By also covering capital expenditure linked to the transition plans, the EU Taxonomy can help attract investors searching for Taxonomy-aligned investments to finance the transition, helping both companies and investors to accelerate the transition to sustainability.

### My company is an SME. Can my company also benefit from the EU Taxonomy?

Businesses of any size, including small companies, can use the EU Taxonomy to explain to investors or stakeholders in general whether they carry out or plan to carry out Taxonomy-aligned green activities. Disclosures are only mandatory for large companies within the scope of the CSRD, but many small companies and businesses could find it useful to disclose the Taxonomy alignment of their activities on a voluntary basis.

SMEs whose business models are focused on one green activity covered by the EU Taxonomy will have only one set of criteria applicable to their business model. For example, a small manufacturer of energy-efficient windows could check relatively easily what share of its turnover, capital expenditure or operating expenditure is related to the sale of windows that comply with the Taxonomy criteria.

### My company’s activity is not covered in the EU Taxonomy. What does that mean for my company?

As the answer to question 7 explains, not all economic activities are covered by the Taxonomy Regulation and its delegated acts. But this does not mean that the EU Taxonomy will be irrelevant to companies active in those sectors that are not covered. The[ TEG in its report ](https://knowledge4policy.ec.europa.eu/publication/sustainable-finance-teg-final-report-eu-taxonomy_en)suggested that companies active in a sector that is not covered by the EU Taxonomy could use it for some of their expenditures into output of other activities that are Taxonomy-aligned (for example a hospital purchasing and installing solar panels, an energy efficient heating system or energy efficient windows from manufacturers that comply with Taxonomy criteria for these activities). The [Transition Finance report](https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/business_economy_euro/banking_and_finance/documents/210319-eu-platform-transition-finance-report_en.pdf) of the Platform on Sustainable Finance also covers this question.

### My company’s activity is not Taxonomy-aligned. Can this activity’s environmental performance still be recognised somehow?

While the EU Taxonomy only reveals whether companies have Taxonomy-aligned activities or not, the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive will require more detailed reporting on a broad range of sustainability issues, including environmental performance indicators. Based on that information, financial market participants can recognise different degrees of environmental performance that have not been categorised by law as Taxonomy-aligned.

Nevertheless, it is important to recall that (i) what does not qualify as a green economic activity under the EU Taxonomy is not necessarily unsustainable given the need to make a ‘substantial contribution’, and (ii) the EU Taxonomy does not constitute a mandatory list for investors to invest in. Thus, financial market participants can choose to invest in companies that carry out activities that have different degrees of environmental performance, including activities that do not comply with the EU Taxonomy criteria. In terms of further policy work, Article 26 of the Taxonomy Regulation calls for a Commission report by the end of 2021 on whether the Taxonomy Regulation should be extended to cover economic activities with no significant impact on the environment as well as economic activities that do significant harm to the environment. The Platform on Sustainable Finance will provide advice to the Commission to feed into that report, and the Platform’s[ report on Transition](https://ec.europa.eu/info/files/210319-eu-platform-transition-finance-report_en) [Finance ](https://ec.europa.eu/info/files/210319-eu-platform-transition-finance-report_en)also covers this issue.

### My company is taking steps to reduce the harmful impact on the environment of its activities. Will this improvement be recognised?

Significant improvements in environmental performance are important and financial markets should be able to recognise them. Under the EU Taxonomy such improvements can only be qualified as Taxonomy-aligned if they lead to the substantial contribution threshold for at least one environmental objective being reached (without doing significant harm to any other objectives and if they comply with the minimum social safeguards). The Taxonomy Regulation identifies environmental performances that go further than simply refraining from doing significant harm.

Article 26 of the Taxonomy Regulation calls for a Commission report by the end of 2021 which will analyse whether the Taxonomy Regulation should be extended to cover economic activities with no significant impact, as well as economic activities that do significant harm to the environment. 

The Platform on Sustainable Finance will provide advice to the Commission to feed into that report, and the Platform’s[ report on Transition](https://ec.europa.eu/info/files/210319-eu-platform-transition-finance-report_en) [Finance ](https://ec.europa.eu/info/files/210319-eu-platform-transition-finance-report_en)also covers this issue. In its report the Commission could look into, among other issues, the question of whether and how to recognise improvements in the environmental performance of activities that are causing significant harm to the environment, even if that improvement does not meet the criteria established for substantial contributions in the EU Taxonomy, but the improvement leads to performance levels better than significant harm. 

### What was the process leading up to the adoption of the Taxonomy Climate Delegated Act and as of when will it apply?

The[ draft of the first Delegated Act ](https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/better-regulation/have-your-say/initiatives/12302-Climate-change-mitigation-and-adaptation-taxonomy%23ISC_WORKFLOW)was published for public feedback on 20 November 2020, with the feedback period ending on 18 December. Based on the feedback received from stakeholders, the Commission issued a[ request for advice ](https://ec.europa.eu/info/files/210118-commission-request-transition-financing_en)to the Platform on Sustainable Finance in January 2021, to explore and give advice on the existing and potential future use of the EU Taxonomy to facilitate the transition towards a sustainable economy. The Platform on Sustainable Finance delivered its[ report on Transition Finance ](https://ec.europa.eu/info/files/210319-eu-platform-transition-finance-report_en)on 19 March.

The Commission considered the stakeholder feedback as well as the report on Transition Finance and made changes to the draft Delegated Act to improve it where such improvement was possible. Stakeholder concerns that are best addressed outside the scope of the Delegated Act will be taken into account in the upcoming Renewed Sustainable Finance Strategy and future policy work. 

The Commission adopted the first Delegated Act on 21 April 2021, on which the European Parliament and the Council will have a scrutiny period of 4 months that can be extended by an additional 2 months. The European Parliament and the Council cannot amend the proposed technical screening criteria: the European Parliament and the Council only have a right to accept or reject the act in its entirety.

Financial entities and companies are already using or considering using the EU Taxonomy framework and will be able to report voluntarily as the first Delegated Act is adopted. For companies under the scope of the NFRD (after its revision, CSRD) mandatory reporting under the Taxonomy Regulation will apply from January 2022 for the climate change mitigation and adaptation objectives, and from January 2023 for the other four objectives.

This timeline was agreed by the European Parliament and the Council in the Taxonomy Regulation. The Commission will explore, including with input from the Platform on Sustainable Finance, appropriate guidance and options for how companies and financial market participants can meaningfully report in the first year of their reporting obligations, taking into account certain data gaps.

### What is the role of the Platform on Sustainable Finance in developing the technical screening criteria?

The Platform on Sustainable Finance is a permanent expert group of the European Commission that has been established under Article 20 of the Taxonomy Regulation. The Platform consists of world-leading sustainability and industry experts representing a wide range of stakeholders, including financial market participants, industry, civil society and academia. According to the Taxonomy Regulation, the Commission has to consult the Platform on Sustainable Finance, before adopting the delegated act on technical screening criteria. The Platform plays a key role in developing the technical screening criteria, as it provides indispensable technical and scientific input to the Commission and allows for a reasoned discussion among experts, reflecting the various stakeholders’ views. The Platform is advising the Commission on the technical screening criteria, as well as on the possible need to update those criteria. The Platform is also advising the Commission on the usability of the technical screening criteria and analysing the impact of the technical screening criteria in terms of potential costs and benefits of their application. As noted above the Platform will also assist the Commission in analyzing requests from stakeholders to develop or revise technical screening criteria for a given economic activity.

In addition to providing advice to the Commission on the development of the technical screening criteria, the Platform is also to advise the Commission on: (i) the further development of the EU Taxonomy framework, (ii) the monitoring of capital flows towards sustainable finance, and (iii) sustainable finance policy development. The Platform has already started its work on these tasks. More information about its work and structure is available on the website of the [Platform on Sustainable Finance.](https://ec.europa.eu/info/business-economy-euro/banking-and-finance/sustainable-finance/overview-sustainable-finance/platform-sustainable-finance_en)

### What role do the minimum safeguards play in the EU Taxonomy Regulation?

The Taxonomy Regulation provides that an economic activity can only qualify as environmentally sustainable if, in addition to meeting the other requirements of Article 3(3)The four criteria laid down in the Article 3 of the Taxonomy Regulation specify that an economic activity shall: (a) contributes substantially to one or more of the environmental objectives set out in Article 9 in accordance with Articles 10 to 16; (b) does not significantly harm any of the environmental objectives set out Article 9 in accordance with Article 17; (c) is carried out in compliance with the minimum safeguards laid down in Article 18; (d) complies with technical screening criteria that have been established by the Commission in accordance with Article 10 (3), 11(3), 12(2), 13(2), 14(2) or 15(2)., it is carried out in compliance with the minimum safeguards laid down in Article 18’. This is in line with the principles enshrined in the [European Pillar of Social Rights](https://commission.europa.eu/system/files/2017-11/social-summit-european-pillar-social-rights-booklet_en.pdf) in support of a sustainable and inclusive growth, as well as with the relevant international minimum human and labour rights standards. 

The minimum safeguards are therefore an integral part of the Taxonomy and are one of the four criteria laid down in Article 3 which must be met for economic activities to be considered environmentally sustainable. The inclusion of minimum safeguards in the Taxonomy framework aims to ensure that entities carrying out economic activities considered as Taxonomy-aligned meet certain minimum social and governance standards. 

In other words, the purpose of the minimum safeguards under the Taxonomy Regulation is to prevent activities and investments from being regarded as ‘sustainable’ if they involve breaches of key social principles and human and labour rights or do not align with minimum standards for responsible business conduct.

### How are the minimum safeguards defined under the Article 18 of the EU Taxonomy?

Article 18 of the Taxonomy Regulation lays down specific requirements for minimum safeguards referring both to international standards of responsible business conduct under Article 18(1) and to the principle of ‘do no significant harm’ of the SFDR(4)Regulation (EU) 2019/2088 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 November 2019 on sustainability‐related disclosures in the financial services sector (OJ L 317, 9.12.2019, p. 1). under Article 18(2). 

Under **Article 18(1),** minimum safeguards are to be understood as due diligence and remedy procedures implemented by a company that is carrying out an economic activity in order to ensure alignment with the [_Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises_](https://www.oecd.org/daf/inv/mne/48004323.pdf) _(OECD MNEs)_ and the [_UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights_](https://www.ohchr.org/sites/default/files/documents/publications/guidingprinciplesbusinesshr_en.pdf) _(UNGP)_. The latter includes the principles and rights set out in eight of the ten fundamental conventions identified in the International Labour Organization (ILO) Declaration of the on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work(5)The core conventions of the International Labour Organisaiton are: _Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,_ 1948 (No.87); _Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention_ , 1949 (No. 98); _Forced Labour Convention_ , 1930 (No. 29) (and its 2014 protocol); _Abolition of Forced Labour Convention_ , 1957 (No. 105); _Minimum Age Convention_ , 1973 (No. 138); _Worst Forms of Child Labour Convention_ , 1999 (No. 182); _Equal Remuneration Convention_ , 1951 (No. 100); _Discrimination (Employment and Occupation) Convention_ , 1958 (No. 111), and the International Bill of Human Rights(6)This includes: _Universal Declaration of Human Rights_ (1948); _International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights_ (1966); and _International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights_ (1966).. 

The [_OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises_](https://www.oecd.org/daf/inv/mne/48004323.pdf) bring together all thematic areas of responsible business conduct and responsible supply chain management. It also recommends that enterprises apply good corporate governance practices, including due diligence(7)See also specific OECD Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible Business Conduct (2018) and OECD sectoral guidance, available at: <https://mneguidelines.oecd.org/mneguidelines/>, which provides practical support to enterprises on the implementation of the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises. as set out in the [_OECD Principles of Corporate Governance_](https://www.oecd.org/daf/ca/Corporate-Governance-Principles-ENG.pdf). 

The [_UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights_](https://www.ohchr.org/sites/default/files/documents/publications/guidingprinciplesbusinesshr_en.pdf) __ (i)specify a standard of conduct for businesses to prevent human-rights violations; and (ii) address any potential risks resulting from the economic activities that businesses conduct. The responsibility of business entities to respect human rights refers to internationally recognised rights understood, as a minimum, as those expressed in eight of the ten fundamental ILO conventions and in the International Bill of Human Rights 

**Article 18(2)** introduces a direct link with the principle of ‘do no significant harm’ (DNSH) referred to in Article 2(17) of the SFDR. This ensures that minimum social standards are defined at European level, and that there is consistency in European legislation. 

The details of the SFDR’s principle of ‘do no significant harm’ are specified in [Delegated Regulation (EU) 2022/1288](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32022R1288&from=EN) adopted by the European Commission in April 2022. According to this regulation, in addition to disclosing whether the sustainable investment is aligned with the OECD MNEs and UN GP, implementing the SFDR principle of do no significant harm requires the consideration of a list of principal adverse indicators. The European Commission considers that, in the context of the Article 18(2) of the Taxonomy Regulation, the link between the minimum safeguards and the principle of DNSH of the SFDR is to be understood, as a minimum, through the SFDR principal adverse impact indicators for social and employee matters, respect for human rights, anti-corruption and anti-bribery matters listed in the table 1 of Annex I of the SDFDR Delegated Regulation.(8)The methodology for the calculation of these indicators can be found in Annex I of the [Delegated Regulation (EU) 2022/1288](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32022R1288&from=EN). The term ‘investee companies’ in table 1 of Annex I of the [Delegated Regulation (EU) 2022/1288](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32022R1288&from=EN) corresponds to references to ‘undertakings’ in the Taxonomy Regulation.

### What are the key expectations for undertakings under Article 18 of the Taxonomy Regulation?

Undertakings disclosing their alignment with the Taxonomy will need to assess their compliance with the Taxonomy’s minimum safeguards requirements under both Article 18(1) and Article 18(2). 

Under **Article 18(1)** , undertakings whose economic activities are to be considered as Taxonomy-aligned must have implemented due diligence and remedy procedures to ensure the alignment with the standards for responsible business conduct mentioned in the [OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises](https://www.oecd.org/daf/inv/mne/48004323.pdf) and the [UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights](https://www.ohchr.org/sites/default/files/documents/publications/guidingprinciplesbusinesshr_en.pdf) (see question 2). Both these texts extensively outline how the principles and conduct of due diligence can be implemented. 

The central requirement under Article 18(1) is that an undertaking must implement appropriate procedures, including procedures to continuously identify, prevent, mitigate or remediate the relevant actual and potential adverse impacts connected with their own operations, value chains and business relationships in order to ensure their activities are carried out in line with these standards. 

Sometimes, despite implementing all appropriate procedures, an undertaking cannot address certain risks or eliminate certain negative impacts. This does not necessarily mean that the undertaking does not comply with the minimum safeguards, provided that the undertaking has clearly disclosed these potential impacts and explained what it did to identify, prevent, mitigate or remediate them and why it could not eliminate certain impacts. In fact, it is recognised that there can be instances where, despite reasonable due diligence measures, undertakings may still not be able to prevent, cease or mitigate adverse impacts when it comes to the adverse impacts in the undertaking’s value chain. 

As part of those due diligence and remedy procedures, companies are required under **Article 18(2)** to consider the SFDR principal adverse impact indicators related to social and employee matters, respect for human rights, anti-corruption and anti-bribery matters referred to under question 2(9)The methodology for the calculation of these indicators can be found in Tables 1 and 3 of Annex I of the [Delegated Regulation (EU) 2022/1288](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32022R1288&from=EN).. 

The only issue covered by Article 18(2) as of today which is not explicitly covered by Article 18(1) is the principal adverse impact relating to the exposure to controversial weapons as defined under the SFDR Delegated Regulation(10)[Delegated Regulation (EU) 2022/1288](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32022R1288&from=EN) (anti-personnel mines, cluster munitions, chemical weapons and biological weapons). Therefore, by virtue of Article 18(2), undertakings are to ensure that their due diligence and remedy procedures allow for the identification, prevention, mitigation or remediation of any actual or potential exposure to the manufacture or selling of controversial weapons. 

Beyond the provisions of Article 18(2) described above, the Taxonomy Regulation does not contain further considerations relating to weapons or defence-related equipment and technologies in the assessment of minimum safeguards. As stated in the [Draft Commission notice on interpretation and implementation of certain legal provisions of the EU Taxonomy Climate Delegated Act](https://ec.europa.eu/finance/docs/law/221219-draft-commission-notice-eu-taxonomy-climate.pdf)(11)Question 11 ‘ _How does the sustainable finance framework apply to access to private funding for the defence industry_?’, p.16., the Commission acknowledges the need to ensure access to finance and investment including from the private sector for all strategic sectors, including the defence industry. The defence industry is recognised as a crucial contributor to the resilience and security of the Union, and therefore to peace and social sustainability(12)See Commission’s proposal for [Proposal for an Act in Support of Ammunition Production](https://defence-industry-space.ec.europa.eu/system/files/2023-05/COM_2023_237_1_EN_ACT.pdf) (ASAP), COM(2023) 237 final..

The list of SFDR indicators related to social and employee matters, respect for human rights, anti-corruption and anti-bribery might change with potential future revisions of the SFDR delegated act. That is why any issue that may be addressed in the future by the adverse indicators of the SFDR will also need to be considered by undertakings according to Article 18(2). 

Reporting in line with the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive(13)Directive (EU) 2022/2464 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 14 December 2022 amending Regulation (EU) No 537/2014, Directive 2004/109/EC, Directive 2006/43/EC and Directive 2013/34/EU, as regards corporate sustainability reporting (OJ L 322, 16.12.2022, p. 15). (CSRD) will help companies to assess their compliance with Article 18 requirements and will help investors to get the necessary information from investee companies(14)The CSRD requires that the sustainability reporting standards that undertakings are required to use to meet their disclosure obligations contain the information that financial market participants need in order to comply with their disclosure obligations under the SFDR. In practice this means that undertakings will be required to report the mirroring information for the principal adverse impact indicators required under the delegated regulation of the SFDR. _Article 29b(5)(b) CSRD_. Article 18 of the EU Taxonomy Regulation does not require additional disclosures, there is therefore no duplication with the CSRD reporting requirements.

### Do Taxonomy-aligned investments qualify as ‘sustainable investment’ under the SFDR?

Recital 19 of the Taxonomy Regulation clarifies that ‘sustainable investments’ under the SFDR include investments into ‘environmentally sustainable economic activities’ within the meaning of the Taxonomy Regulation. 

In setting out what is required for an activity to be considered as ‘environmentally sustainable’, Article 18(2) makes a link between the Taxonomy Regulation and the SFDR via one of the required steps of the Taxonomy Regulation: the compliance with minimum safeguards. According to the guidance given under question 1 and 2 above, the social elements of the ‘do no significant harm’ principle are considered to be adhered to at entity level for an undertaking that discloses activities as ‘environmentally sustainable’ under the EU Taxonomy. 

Furthermore, according to the guidance provided in questions 1 and 2 above, the SFDR do no significant harm principle and the requirement to ensure that an investee company follows good governance practices are deemed to be fulfilled for investments in Taxonomy-aligned economic activities as these comply with the Taxonomy’s minimum safeguards. The four aspects of good governance referred to in point 17 of Article 2 of the SFDR (namely sound management structures, employee relations, remuneration of staff and tax compliance(15)The [EU list of non-cooperative jurisdictions for tax purposes](https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/policies/eu-list-of-non-cooperative-jurisdictions/) was updated in February 2023. It provides useful guidance to identify countries which have failed to fulfil their commitments to comply with tax good governance criteria within a specific timeframe, and countries which have refused to do so.) can be considered to be satisfied by the provisions referred to in Article 18 of Regulation (EU) 2020/852. 

Therefore, such investments in Taxonomy-aligned ‘environmentally sustainable’ economic activities can be automatically qualified as ‘sustainable investments’ in the context of the product level disclosure requirements under the SFDR. This means that investments in specific economic activities can be considered to be sustainable investments. 

However, if a financial market participant (FMP) invests in an undertaking with some degree of taxonomy-alignment through a funding instrument that does not specify the use of proceeds, such as a general equity or debt, the FMP would still need to check additional elements under the SFDR in order to consider the whole investment in that undertaking as sustainable investment. This means that the FMP would still need to: (i) check whether the rest of the economic activities of the undertaking comply with the environmental elements of the SFDR DNSH principle; and (ii) assess whether she/he considers the contribution to the environmental objective sufficient.
